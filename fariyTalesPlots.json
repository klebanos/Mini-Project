    "plot": "\nThe folktale begins with a princess whose parents are told by a wicked fairy that their daughter will die when she pricks her finger on a particular item. In Basile's version, the princess pricks her finger on a piece of flax. In Perrault's and the Grimm Brothers' versions, the item is a spindle. The parents rid the kingdom of these items in the hopes of protecting their daughter, but the prophecy is fulfilled regardless. Instead of dying, as was foretold, the princess falls into a deep sleep. After some time, she is found by a prince and is awakened. In Giambattista Basile's version of Sleeping Beauty, Sun, Moon, and Talia, the sleeping beauty, Talia, falls into a deep sleep after getting a splinter of flax in her finger. When she is discovered in her castle by a wandering king, he \"...gathers the first fruits of love.\" and leaves her there where she later gives birth to a set of twins.According to Maria Tatar, there are versions of the story that include a second part to the narrative that details the couple's troubles after their union; some folklorists believe the two parts were originally separate tales.The second part begins after the prince and princess have had children. Through the course of the tale, the princess and her children are introduced in some way to another woman from the prince's life. This other woman is not fond of the prince's new family, and calls a cook to kill the children and serve them for dinner. Instead of obeying, the cook hides the children and serves livestock. Next, the other woman orders the cook to kill the princess. Before this can happen, the other woman's true nature is revealed to the prince and then she is subjected to the very death that she had planned for the princess. The princess, prince, and their children live happily ever after.\n\n\n"

    "name": "Hansel and Gretel",
    "plot": "The story is set in medieval Germany. Hansel and Gretel are the young children of a poor woodcutter. When a great famine settles over the land, the woodcutter's wife (originally the children's mother but in revised editions she is their stepmother) decides to take the children into the woods and leave them there to fend for themselves, so that she and her husband do not starve to death, as the children eat too much. The woodcutter opposes the plan but finally, and reluctantly, submits to his wife's scheme. They are unaware that in the children's bedroom, Hansel and Gretel have overheard them. After the parents have gone to bed, Hansel sneaks out of the house and gathers as many white pebbles as he can, then returns to his room, reassuring Gretel that God will not forsake them.\nThe next day, the family walk deep into the woods and Hansel lays a trail of white pebbles. After their parents abandon them, the children wait for the moon to rise and then they followed the pebbles back home. They return home safely, much to their stepmother's rage. Once again provisions become scarce and the mother angrily orders her husband to take the children further into the woods and leave them there to die. Hansel and Gretel attempt to gather more pebbles, but find the doors locked and find it impossible to escape.\n\nThe following morning, the family treks into the woods. Hansel takes a slice of bread and leaves a trail of bread crumbs for them to follow home. However, after they are once again abandoned, they find that the birds have eaten the crumbs and they are lost in the woods. After days of wandering, they follow a beautiful white bird to a clearing in the woods, and discover a large cottage built of gingerbread, cakes, candy and with window panes of clear sugar. Hungry and tired, the children begin to eat the rooftop of the house, when the door opens and a \"very old woman\" emerges and lures the children inside, with the promise of soft beds and delicious food. They do this without knowing the fact that their hostess is a bloodthirsty witch who built the gingerbread house to waylay children to cook and eat them.\nThe next morning, the witch locks Hansel in an iron cage in the garden and forces Gretel into becoming a slave. The witch feeds Hansel regularly to fatten him up, but Hansel cleverly offers a bone he found in the cage (presumably a bone from the witch's previous captive) and the witch feels it, thinking it to be his finger. Due to her blindness, she is fooled into thinking Hansel is still too thin to eat. After weeks of this, the witch grows impatient and decides to eat Hansel, \"be he fat or lean\".\nShe prepares the oven for Hansel, but decides she is hungry enough to eat Gretel, too. She coaxes Gretel to the open oven and prods her to lean over in front of it to see if the fire is hot enough. Gretel, sensing the witch's intent, pretends she does not understand what she means. Infuriated, the witch demonstrates, and Gretel instantly shoves the witch into the hot oven, slams and bolts the door shut, leaving \"The ungodly witch to be burned in ashes\". Gretel frees Hansel from the cage and the pair discover a vase full of treasure and precious stones. Putting the jewels into their clothing, the children set off for home. A swan ferries them across an expanse of water and at home they find only their father; his wife died from unknown cause. Their father had spent all his days lamenting the loss of his children, and is delighted to see them safe and sound. With the witch's wealth, they all live happily ever after.\n\n\n"

    "plot": "The tale opens with the third and youngest son of a miller receiving his inheritance\u2014a cat. At first, the youngest son laments, as the eldest brother gains the mill, and the middle brother gets the mules. The feline is no ordinary cat, however, but one who requests and receives a pair of boots. Determined to make his master's fortune, the cat bags a rabbit in the forest and presents it to the king as a gift from his master, the fictional Marquis of Carabas. The cat continues making gifts of game to the king for several months, for which he is rewarded.\n\nOne day, the king decides to take a drive with his daughter. The cat persuades his master to remove his clothes and enter the river which their carriage passes. The cat disposes of his master's clothing beneath a rock. As the royal coach nears, the cat begins calling for help in great distress. When the king stops to investigate, the cat tells him that his master the Marquis has been bathing in the river and robbed of his clothing. The king has the young man brought from the river, dressed in a splendid suit of clothes, and seated in the coach with his daughter, who falls in love with him at once.\nThe cat hurries ahead of the coach, ordering the country folk along the road to tell the king that the land belongs to the \"Marquis of Carabas\", saying that if they do not he will cut them into mincemeat. The cat then happens upon a castle inhabited by an ogre who is capable of transforming himself into a number of creatures. The ogre displays his ability by changing into a lion, frightening the cat, who then tricks the ogre into changing into a mouse. The cat then pounces upon the mouse and devours it. The king arrives at the castle that formerly belonged to the ogre, and, impressed with the bogus Marquis and his estate, gives the lad the princess in marriage. Thereafter, the cat enjoys life as a great lord who runs after mice only for his own amusement.The tale is followed immediately by two morals: \"one stresses the importance of possessing industrie and savoir faire while the other extols the virtues of dress, countenance, and youth to win the heart of a princess.\" The Italian translation by Carlo Collodi notes that the tale gives useful advice if you happen to be a cat or a Marquis of Carabas.\nThis is the theme in France, but other versions of this theme exist in Asia, Africa, and South America.\n\n\n"

He is a young king with such a thick beard, that to her it looks like a thrush's beak, so she cruelly dubs him King Thrushbeard. He leaves in anger. Her father, exasperated and angry at how she scorned them all, vows that the first man who comes to the palace the next day, whether he be a noble or a peasant, will become her husband. Meanwhile, an unknown stranger overhears the conversation.\nWhen a young minstrel with a clean shaven face appears in the palace the next day, the king offers his daughter's hand in marriage. He disapproves of marrying her immediately as she does not look strong nor does she appear to be capable of any practical work. However, he notes the poor cannot be choosy and agrees to marry her. She opposes vehemently because he is a commoner, but the king has given his word. She marries him and he takes her away from the palace to his home.\nAs they travel to the minstrel's home, they pass by the fine lands and properties that belong to King Thrushbeard, and the princess begins to regret scorning him.

She refuses to eat anything else and begins to waste away. Her husband fears for her life and one night he breaks into the garden to get some for her. When he returns, she makes a salad out of it and eats it, but she longs for more so her husband returns to the garden to retrieve more. As he scales the wall to return home, the sorceress catches him and accuses him of theft. He begs for mercy and she agrees to be lenient, allowing him to take all the rapunzel he wants on condition that the baby be given to her when it's born. Desperate, he agrees. When his wife has a baby girl, the sorceress takes her to raise as her own and names her \"Rapunzel\" after the plant her mother craved. She grows up to be a beautiful child with long golden hair.

To his horror, he finds himself meeting her instead of Rapunzel, who is nowhere to be found. After she tells him in a rage that he will never see Rapunzel again, he leaps or falls from the tower, landing in a thorn bush. Although the thorn bush breaks his fall and saves his life, it scratches his eyes and blinds him.\nFor years, he wanders through the wastelands of the country and eventually comes to the wilderness where Rapunzel now lives with the twins to whom she has given birth, a boy and a girl. One day, as she sings, he hears her voice again, and they are reunited. When they fall into each other's arms her tears immediately restore his sight. He leads her and their twins to his kingdom where they live happily ever after.Another version of the story ends with the revelation that her foster mother had untied Rapunzel's hair after the prince leapt from the tower, and it slipped from her hands and landed far below, leaving her trapped in the tower.\n\n\n"

When next morning the king takes the girl to a larger room filled with straw to repeat the feat, the imp once again spins, in return for the girl's ring. On the third day, when the girl has been taken to an even larger room filled with straw and told by the king that he will marry her if she can fill this room with gold or execute her if she cannot, the girl has nothing left with which she can pay the strange creature. He extracts from her a promise that she will give him her firstborn child, and so he spins the straw into gold a final time. (In some versions, the imp appears and begins to turn the straw into gold, paying no heed to the girl's protests that she has nothing to pay him with; when he finishes the task, he states that the price is her first child, and the horrified girl objects because she never agreed to this arrangement.)\n\nThe king keeps his promise to marry the miller's daughter, but when their first child is born, the imp returns to claim his payment: \"Now give me what you promised.\" She offers him all the wealth she has to keep the child, but the imp has no interest in her riches.\nHe finally consents to give up his claim to the child if she can guess his name within three days (some versions have the imp limiting the number of daily guesses to three and hence the total number of guesses allowed to a maximum of nine).\nHer many guesses fail, but before the final night, she wanders into the woods (in some versions, she sends a servant into the woods instead of going herself, in order to keep the king's suspicions at bay) searching for him and comes across his remote mountain cottage and watches, unseen, as he hops about his fire and sings. In his song's lyrics\u2014 \"tonight tonight, my plans I make, tomorrow tomorrow, the baby I take. The queen will never win the game, for Rumpelstiltskin is my name\"\u2014 he reveals his name.\nWhen the imp comes to the queen on the third day, after first feigning ignorance, she reveals his name, Rumpelstiltskin, and he loses his temper and their bargain. Versions vary about whether he accuses the devil or witches of having revealed his name to the queen. In the 1812 edition of the Brothers Grimm tales, Rumpelstiltskin then \"ran away angrily, and never came back.\" The ending was revised in an 1857 edition to a more gruesome ending wherein Rumpelstiltskin \"in his rage drove his right foot so far into the ground that it sank in up to his waist; then in a passion he seized the left foot with both hands and tore himself in two.\" Other versions have Rumpelstiltskin driving his right foot so far into the ground that he creates a chasm and falls into it, never to be seen again. In the oral version originally collected by the Brothers Grimm, Rumpelstiltskin flies out of the window on a cooking ladle.\n\n\n"

An old man lived there and, after the tailor begged, allowed him to stay for the night. In the morning, the tailor awoke to witness a fight between a great stag and a bull. After the stag won, it bounded up to him and carried him off in its antlers. It set him down before a wall of stone and pushed him against a door in it, which then opened. Inside the door, he was told to stand on a stone, which would bring him good fortune. He did so, and it sank down into a great hall, where the voice directed him to look into a glass chest. The chest contained a beautiful maiden, who asked him to open the chest and free her, and he did so.\nThe maiden told him her story: She was the daughter of a rich count, and after the death of her parents, she had been raised by her brother. One day, a traveler stayed the night and used magic to get to her in the night, to ask her to marry him. She found the use of magic repellent and rejected his proposal. In revenge the magician then turned her brother into the stag, imprisoned her in the glass chest (coffin), and enchanted all the lands around them.\nThe tailor and the maiden emerged from the enchanted hall and found that the stag had been transformed back into her brother. The bull he had killed had been the magician.  The tailor and the maiden then married.\n\n\n"

He makes a belt describing the deed, reading \"Seven at One Blow\". Inspired, he sets out into the world to seek his fortune. The tailor meets a giant who assumes that \"Seven at One Blow\" refers to seven men. The giant challenges the tailor. When the giant squeezes water from a boulder, the tailor squeezes milk, or whey, from cheese. The giant throws a rock far into the air, and it eventually lands. The tailor counters the feat by tossing a bird that flies away into the sky; the giant believes the small bird is a \"rock\" which is thrown so far that it never lands. Later, the giant asks the tailor to help him carry a tree. The tailor directs the giant to carry the trunk, while the tailor will carry the branches. Instead, the tailor climbs on, so the giant carries him as well, but it appears as if the tailor is supporting the branches.\nImpressed, the giant brings the tailor to the giant's home, where other giants live as well. During the night, the giant attempts to kill the tailor by bashing the bed. However, the tailor, having found the bed too large, had slept in the corner. Upon returning and seeing the tailor alive, the other giants flee in fear of the small man.\nThe tailor enters the royal service, but the other soldiers are afraid that he will lose his temper someday, and then seven of them might die with every blow. They tell the king that either the tailor leaves military service or they will. Afraid of being killed for sending him away, the king instead attempts to get rid of the tailor by sending him to defeat two giants along with a hundred horsemen, offering him half his kingdom and his daughter's hand in marriage if the tailor can kill the giants. By throwing rocks at the two giants while they sleep, the tailor provokes the pair into fighting each other until they kill each other, at which time the tailor stabs the giants in their hearts.\n\nThe king, surprised the tailor has succeeded, balks on his promise, and requires more of the tailor before he may claim his rewards. The king next sends him after a unicorn, another seemingly impossible task, but the tailor traps it by standing before a tree, so that when the unicorn charges, he steps aside and it drives its horn into the trunk. The king subsequently sends him after a wild boar, but the tailor traps it in a chapel with a similar luring technique.\nDuly impressed, the king relents, marries the tailor to the princess, and makes the tailor the ruler of half the original kingdom. The tailor's new wife hears him talking in his sleep and realizes with fury that he was merely a tailor and not a noble hero. Upon the princess's demands, the king promises to have him killed or carried off. A squire warns the tailor of the king's plan. While the king's servants are outside the door, the brave little tailor pretends to be talking in his sleep and says \"Boy, make the jacket for me, and patch the trousers, or I will hit you across your ears with a yardstick! I have struck down seven with one blow, killed two giants, led away a unicorn, and captured a wild boar, and I am supposed to be afraid of those who are standing just outside the bedroom!\"  Terrified, the king's servants leave. The king does not try to assassinate the tailor again and so the tailor lives out his days as a king in his own right.\n\n\n"

He states further that the only key to the cage is hidden beneath the queen's pillow.\nThough the prince hesitates at first, he eventually builds up the courage to sneak into his mother's room and steal the key.

The king hopes that the mysterious knight who saved the kingdom will show himself for such a prize. Again the prince asks Iron John for help, and again Iron John disguises the prince as the mysterious knight. Though the prince catches the golden apple and escapes, and does so again on two more occasions, he is eventually found.\nThe prince is returned to his former station, marries the princess, and is happily reunited with his parents. Iron John too comes to the wedding. This time, he is seen without the shaggy hair or iron skin that made him frightening.

By the third, the man's daughter washes with and drinks water, while the woman's daughter drinks wine and washes with milk. It remains this way afterwards, because the woman secretly hates her step-daughter due to her being prettier than her own.\nOne day during winter, the step-mother makes her step-daughter put on a paper dress and go out to find strawberries. The girl is horrified by this, as no fruit can be found in winter and the dress will not protect her from the cold. The step-mother forces her to go out, forbidding her return until strawberries are brought. In reality, this is a plot to get rid of the girl due to the step-mother's immense hatred of her. The girl soon finds a small house with three little men inside. She shows great courtesy towards them as a houseguest, offers them her coarse food given by the step-mother, and cleans house for them also. The men, feeling sorry for her circumstances, decide to give her three gifts: she will grow prettier every day, gold will fall from her mouth at every word, and she will one day marry a king.

When they are alone, they both seize the queen and toss her out the window, where she falls into a stream and drowns. The woman's daughter is immediately given the place of the queen, and the king is told she is sick, so toads now come from her mouth instead of gold.\nDuring the night, the kitchen-boy witnesses a duck swim up the gutter and ask for the statuses of the king and baby. The boy answers they sleep quietly. The duck temporarily turns into the queen to care for her baby and swims off as a duck through the gutter. This happens again two more times: on the third, she tells the kitchen-boy to tell the king to brandish his sword over her three times. The boy tells the king, who does so, and the duck turns back into the queen, who comes back to life.\nThe king hides his wife during his child's baptism to confront the step-mother and false queen. He asks the step-mother what the punishment should be for someone who drags another from bed and drowns them: the woman foolishly answers that they should be placed in a cask with nails inside and rolled down a hill into the water.

In Joseph Jacobs's version, her country had been at war with his, and the portrait stems from betrothal negotiations that had fallen through; but in all versions, the king does not know how to win her.

One says that as soon as they reach shore, a horse will come; if the king mounts it, it will fly into the air with him, and neither will be seen again. The solution is for someone to kill the horse, but anyone who reveals this by stating it out loud would have his legs turn to stone up to the knees. The second raven says (with variations in different tellings) that the king would be killed by wine at the wedding feast if it were not dashed to the ground, or that he would be incinerated by a wedding shirt if it was not destroyed by a glove-wearing person, etc.; in all variants, whoever says so would turn to stone to his waist.  The third raven says, again in different variants, that the princess would faint and die unless someone draws three drops of blood from her right breast; or a dragon would attack their bridal chamber and unless driven off, kill them. True to form, whoever states this would turn entirely to stone.\nJohn prevents all three fates. For the first two, the king trusts that John has acted in his service; but for the third, the king decides to execute him.  At the place of execution, John tells the story of the ravens and turns progressively to stone.\nIn time, the queen bears twin sons. The king learns that if he kill the boys and rub John's statue with their blood, he would come to life again. The king does this, and upon John's resurrection, he does the same to the boys and resurrects them. Later, John and the twins hide in a closet as the king explains what would need to be done to bring John back to test her loyalty. When the queen agrees to the sacrifice, John and the twins emerge from the door and embrace everyone. The king and queen live happily until their deaths.\n\n\n"

When the sexton did not answer, the boy, unafraid, pushed him down the stairs, breaking his leg.\nHis horrified father turned him out of house, so the boy set out to learn how to shudder. He complained whenever he could, \"If only I could shudder!\"  One man advised him to stay the night beneath the gallows, where seven hanged men were still hanging.  He did so, and set a fire for the night.  When the hanged bodies shook in the wind, he thought they must be cold. He cut them down and sat them close to his fire, but they did not stir even when their clothing caught on fire. The boy, annoyed at their carelessness, hung them back up in the gallows.\nAfter the incident at the gallows, he began traveling with a waggoner. When one night they arrived at an inn, the inn-keeper told him that if he wanted to know how to shudder, he should visit the haunted castle nearby.  If he could manage to stay there for three nights in a row, he could learn how to shudder, as well as win the king's daughter and all of the rich treasures of the castle. Many men had tried, but none had succeeded.\nThe boy accepted the challenge and went to the king. The king agreed, and told him that he may bring with him three non-living things into the castle. The boy asked for a fire, a lathe, and a cutting board with a knife.\nThe first night, as the boy sat in his room, two voices from the corner of the room moaned into the night, complaining about the cold. The boy, unafraid, claimed that the owners of the voices were stupid not to warm themselves with the fire. Suddenly, two black cats jumped out of the corner and, seeing the calm boy, proposed a card game. The boy tricked the cats and trapped them with the cutting board and knife. Black cats and dogs emerged from every patch of darkness in the room, and the boy fought and killed each of them with his knife. Then, from the darkness, a bed appeared. He lay down on it, preparing for sleep, but it began walking all over the castle. Still unafraid, the boy urged it to go faster. The bed turned upside down on him, but the boy, unfazed, just tossed the bed aside and slept next to the fire until morning.\nAs the boy settled in for his second night in the castle, half of a man fell down the chimney. The boy, again unafraid, shouted up the chimney that the other half was needed. The other half, hearing the boy, fell from the chimney and reunited with the rest. More men followed with human skulls and dead men's legs with which to play nine-pins. The amused boy shaped the skulls into better balls with his lathe and joined the men until midnight, when they vanished into thin air.\nOn his third and final night in the castle, the boy heard a strange noise. Six men entered his room, carrying a coffin. The boy, unafraid but distraught, believed the body to be his own dead cousin. As he tried to warm the body, it came back to life, and, confusedly, threatened to strangle him. The boy, angry at his ingratitude, closed the coffin on top of the man again. An old man hearing the noise came to see the boy. He visited with him, bragging that he could knock an anvil straight to the ground. The old man brought him to the basement and, while showing the boy his trick, the boy split the anvil and trapped the old man's beard in it, and then proceeded to beat the man with an iron rod. The man, desperate for mercy, showed the boy all of the treasures in the castle.\nThe following morning, the king told the boy that he could win his lovely daughter. The boy agreed, though upset that he had still not learned how to shudder.\nAfter their wedding, the boy's continuing complaints annoyed his wife to no end. Reaching her wits' end, she sent for a bucketful of stream water, complete with gudgeons. She tossed the freezing water onto her husband while he was asleep. As he awoke, shuddering, he exclaimed that while he had finally learned to shudder, he still did not know what true fear was.\n\n\n"

    "name": "Ye Xian",
    "plot": "Long before the Qin  and Han Dynasty, in a small community of cave-dwellers called Wudong, their chief by the name of Wu had two wives by custom and a daughter by each of them. Ye Xian is Wu's daughter of one wife, and she is extremely beautiful, kind and gentle, and gifted in many skills such as pottery and poetry. In contrast, her half-sister Jun-Li is plain-looking, cruel and selfish, and both she and her mother, Wu's other wife Jin, envy the attention Wu lavishes upon Ye Xian. Ye Xian's mother died while she was still a baby, so Wu did all he could to raise his motherless daughter.\nUnfortunately, Ye Xian's father dies from a local plague, and a new chieftain was appointed to take his place, as Wu had no sons. With her family reduced to poverty, Ye Xian is forced to become a lowly servant and work for her unloving and cruel stepmother, Jin, and spoiled and lazy younger half-sister Junli.  Despite living a life burdened with chores and housework, and suffering endless abuse at her stepmother's hands, she finds solace when she ends up befriending a beautiful, 10 foot long fish in the lake near her home, with golden eyes and scales. The fish was really a guardian spirit sent to her by her own mother, who never forgot her daughter even beyond the grave.\nOne day, Jun-Li follows Ye Xian to the lake, and discovers her talking to the fish. Angry that Ye Xian has found happiness, she told her mother everything that she had seen. The cruel woman tricked Ye Xian into giving her the tattered dress she wears, and by this, catches and kills the fish and serves it for dinner for herself and Jun-Li.  Ye Xian is devastated until the spirit of an old man, possibly one of her ancestors or her maternal grandfather, in a white robe with white hair, appears and tells her to bury the bones of the fish in four pots and hide each pot at the corners under her bed. The spirit also tells her that whatever she needs will be granted if she talks to the bones.\nOnce in a year, the New Year Festival was to be celebrated. This is also the time for the young maidens to meet potential husbands.  Not wishing to spoil her own daughter's chances, the stepmother forces her stepdaughter to remain home and clean their cave-house.  After her step-family has left for the festival, Ye Xian is visited by the fish's spirit again. She makes a silent wish to the bones and Ye Xian finds herself clothed magnificently, in a gown of sea-green silk, a cloak of kingfisher feathers and a pair of tiny golden slippers.\nYe Xian goes to the festival by foot. She is admired by everyone, in particular the young men who believed her to be a princess, and enjoys herself until she hears Jun-Li call out to the crowd \"That girl looks like my older sister!\" Realizing that her family might have recognized her Ye Xian leaves, accidentally leaving behind a golden slipper.  When she arrives home, she hides her finery and the remaining slipper under her bed. The fish bones were silent now, however, for it warned Ye Xian before not to lose even one of her slippers. Sadly, she falls asleep under a tree. Her step family return from the festival and mention a mysterious beauty who appeared at the festival, but are unaware that it is Ye Xian they are speaking of.\nThe golden slipper is found by a local peasant who trades it, and it is passed on to various people until it reaches the hands of the nearby king of the To'Han islets, a powerful kingdom covering thousands of small islands. Fascinated by the shoe's small size,\nhe issues a search to find the maiden whose foot will fit into the shoe and proclaims he will marry that girl. The search extends until it reaches the community of the cave-dwellers, and everyone, even Jun-Li, tried the slipper. No maiden's foot can fit the shoe. Despondent that he could not find the woman he was searching for, the king made a great pavilion and placed the shoe there on display. Ye Xian arrives there late in the evening to retrieve the slipper, but is mistaken as a thief. Ye Xian then was brought before the king, and there she told him everything about her life, how she lost her friend, the gold-eyed fish, and now her slipper. The king, struck by her good-nature and beauty even though she lived in the land of the savages, believed her and allowed her to go home with the slipper.\nThe next morning, the king goes into Ye Xian's house and asks her to come with him into his kingdom. Ye Xian then wears both her shoes, and appears in her beautiful sea-green gown. The stepmother and Jun-Li, however, insist that Ye Xian could not have clothes of that kind...for she is only their slave. The stepmother says that the finery is Jun-Li's, and that Ye Xian stole them. The king dismisses her lies, and invites Ye Xian to marry him and live in his palace. She accepts, but her cruel step-family is left with the worst possible fate: each other. The stepmother forces Jun-Li, who has lost all hope of marrying rich, into the same state of servitude that Ye Xian suffered for so many years. When Jun-Li promptly and bitterly rebels against her lot, it starts a violent quarrel...the result of which is a cave-in that buries both women and destroys their home. Meanwhile, the king takes Ye Xian's hand in marriage and makes her his queen.\n\n\n"

The king set him to watch his three daughters; one each night. The king told the boy that he would call on the prince each hour and if he answered every time, he could marry his daughter, but if not, he would be killed.  Each daughter enchanted a statue of St. Christopher to answer in the prince's place, thus saving the prince from death.\nThe king said that in order to marry one of his daughters, he had to cut down a forest in a day; the king gave him a glass axe, a glass mallet, and a glass wedge to complete the task.  When the prince went to the forest, the glass broke, and he wept knowing he would be killed.  Finally having felt that he had outwitted the prince, the king told his daughters to bring him some food. The youngest daughter brought it, and told her father to let her comb his hair. The king fell asleep, allowing her to conjure up Earth-workers to fell the forest.\nAstonished that the prince had completed his task, the king then ordered him to clear a muddy pond and fill it with fish in a day.  When the king's son tried, his hoe and shovel stuck in the mud and broke. Once again, the youngest daughter brought her father food and got him to sleep; then she conjured the Earth workers to clear the pond.\nThe king then ordered the prince to clear a mountain of briars and put a castle on it.  The glass hatchet he was given broke on the first briars; the youngest daughter saved him again.\nFinally, the king declared that the youngest daughter could not marry until her older sisters were married. Hearing this, the couple decided to run away at night.  Once they were on their way, the king's daughter heard her father behind them.  She turned herself into a rose, and the king's son into a briar.  Believing he had lost them, the king returned home only to be told by his wife that the briar and the rose had been the children. The king  chased them after again and this time the king's daughter turned herself into a priest, and the king's son into a church where she preached a sermon.  The king listened to the sermon and went home where, once again, his wife told him that the priest and church were the children. Tired of her husband, the queen went after the children her self; the daughter realized the queen would know their true forms, but she changed herself into a duck and the king's son into a pond.  The queen tried to drink the pool, but became ill and told her daughter she could come back.  The daughter did, and the queen gave her three walnuts to aid her.\nThe king's son and the king's daughter went on.  The king's son had her stay while he went to get her carriage to bring her back in due state, but his mother kissed him, and he forgot the king's daughter entirely.  The king's daughter had to work for a miller.\nOne day, the queen sought a bride for her son.  The king's daughter cracked one walnut and found a splendid dress in it.  She wore it to the wedding.  The bride declared she would not marry without a dress as fine.  The king's daughter would not give it up unless she could spend a night outside the king's son's bedroom.  The bride agreed but had the servants give the king's son a potion so he slept.  She lamented all night long; the king's son did not hear, but the servants did.  In the morning, the bride took the dress and went with the king's son to the church, but the king's daughter cracked the second walnut, and it held a more splendid dress, and the bride again refused to marry without one as fine.  The king's daughter asked the same price, and the bride agreed and gave the same order, but the servant, who had heard, gave the king's son something to keep him awake.  He heard her laments and was troubled by them.  His mother had locked the door, but in the morning, he begged her pardon.  The king's daughter cracked the third walnut and found much more splendid dress and wore it as her wedding gown, but the bride and the false mother were sent away.\n\n\n"

He found it burdensome, but she would not let him even rest.  When they arrived at the hut, there was an ugly girl tending the old woman's geese, but the old woman would not let them stay together, lest \"he may fall in love with her\".  Before the old woman sent the count away, she gave him a box cut out of an emerald as thanks for carrying her burden.\nThe count wandered the woods for three days before he arrived at a town where a king and queen reigned.  He showed them the box.  When the queen saw the box, she collapsed as if dead, and the count was led to a dungeon and kept there. When the queen woke, she insisted on speaking with him.  She told him that her youngest daughter had been a beautiful girl who wept pearls and jewels.  But one day, when the king had asked his three daughters how well they loved him, the youngest said that she loved him like salt. The king divided his kingdom between the two older girls and drove the youngest out, giving her only a sack of salt.  The king regretted this decision afterward, but the girl was never to be found again.\nWhen the queen had opened the box, a pearl just like how her daughter's jewel tears looked like was in it.  The count told them where he had gotten the box, and the king and queen resolved to speak with the old woman.\nMeanwhile, in the mountains, the ugly girl washed in a well by night.  She became a beautiful girl, though sad.  She returned to her usual form when the moonlight was blocked. When she returned to the hut, the old woman was cleaning the hut, although it was late.  The old woman told the girl that it had been three years, so they could stay no longer together. The girl was upset, and asked what would happen to her, but the old woman said that she was disrupting her work and sent her to wait in her room.\nThe count had gone with the king and queen but become separated.  He saw the ugly girl make herself beautiful and was entranced by her beauty.  He followed her, and met with the king and queen at the hut.  The old woman said to the king and queen that they could have spared themselves a walk if they had not been so unjust to their daughter. She led them in and told their daughter to come out of the room, and the family wept to see each other again.\nThe old woman disappeared and the hut became a castle.

The old woman there warned him that it is a den of robbers, but he stayed, and when the robbers arrived, he persuaded them to take him on as a servant.\nThey set him to prove himself by stealing an ox that a man brought to market to sell.  He took a shoe with a silver buckle and left it in the road.  The man saw it and thought it would be good if only he had the other, and went on.  The son took the shoe and ran through the countryside, to leave it in the road again. The man left his ox and went back to find the other, and the son drove the ox off.\nThe man went back to get the second ox to sell it, and the robbers told the son that if he stole that one as well, they would take him into the band.  The son hanged himself up along the way, and when the man passed, ran on and hanged himself again, and then a third time, until the man was half-convinced that it was witchcraft and went back to see if the first two bodies were still hanging, and the son drove off his ox.\nThe man went for his third and last ox, and the robbers said that they would make him the band's leader if he stole it.  The son made a sound like an ox bellowing in the woods, and the man, thinking it was his stolen oxen, ran off, leaving the third behind, and the son stole that one as well.\nThe robbers were not pleased with his leading the band, and so they all left him.  The son drove the oxen out, so they returned to their owner, took all the treasure in the house, and returned to his father.\nHe decided to marry the daughter of a local squire and sent his father to ask for her hand, telling him to tell the squire that he was a Master Thief.  The squire agreed, if the son could steal the roast from the spit on Sunday.

The grooms demanded some, and he gave them a drugged drink, putting them to sleep, and stole the horses.\nThe squire put him off again, asking if he could steal a horse while he was riding it.  The Master Thief said he could, and disguised himself as an old man with a cask of mead, and put his finger in the hole, in place of the tap.  The squire rode up and asked him if he would look in the woods, to be sure that the Master Thief did not lurk there.  The Master Thief said that he could not, because he had to keep the mead from spilling, and the squire took his place and lent him his horse to look.\nThe squire put him off again, asking if he could steal the sheet off his bed and his wife's shift.

None of them ever managed to bring those to a good end, so she has all who failed beheaded.\nOne day, a prince hears about the princess and wants to compete to win her hand. At first his father forbids him to do so, but the son falls ill for seven years without a physician being able to help him. Only when the father allows him to go does his health improve. During his voyage the prince meets six men with amazing talents and powers, whom he all takes along to be his servants. The first one is a man with a belly as huge as a small mountain who is able to stretch himself out to even bigger obesity. The second is a man who is able to hear even the tiniest sound, demonstrated by the fact that when the prince meets him he is listening to the grass growing and can also hear someone being beheaded in the evil Queen's castle. The third servant is an incredibly tall man. The fourth one a man who wears a blindfold in front of his eyes because his glance is so powerful that it makes everything he sees split to pieces. The fifth servant is a man who feels cold in extreme heat and hot in extreme frost. The sixth and final servant is a man who can stretch his long neck to see over long distances.\nThe prince and his servants arrive at the Queen's castle. He is told to fulfill three tasks to gain her daughter's hand in marriage. First he has to fetch a ring which the Queen dropped in the Red Sea. The man with the sharp eyesight notices the ring, hanging on a pointy rock. The obese man drinks the sea dry, whereupon the tall man picks the ring up with ease. The Queen is surprised that they managed to safely perform the first task, but orders the second task next. The prince has to eat three hundred oxen, skin, hair, bones, horns and all, and drink three hundred casks of wine to the last drop. If any trace of these are found then he will lose his life. The prince asks whether he's allowed to have one guest join him and his wish is granted. Naturally he brings the obese servant along and in less than no time everything is finished.\nFor the final task the prince has to guard the princess in her room with his arms around her. If the Queen returns around the clock of midnight and the princess is no longer in his arms, then his life will be lost. The prince takes precautions by having the Tall servant and Obese servant surround him and the princess, so that nobody can touch them. However, the Queen casts a spell over them, which sets them off into a deep sleep. She then carries the princess away. At a quarter to twelve everybody awakes and the prince panics. The man with the amazing sense of hearing listens and hears her crying on a rock, three hundred leagues away. The Tall One rises, takes a few steps and runs towards them, taking the servant with the sharp eyesight with him. The latter looks at the rock, causing it to shatter into a thousand pieces, while the Tall One grabs the princess and brings her back before deadline.\nWith all three tasks fulfilled the Queen whispers in the princess' ear that it's a shame that she has to obey common people and not being allowed to choose a husband to her own liking. This makes the princess angry. Next day she orders three hundred great bundles of wood to be lit on fire. If someone is able to sit in the midst of the wood and bear the fire then she'll truly marry him. The servant who can't stand cold fulfills the task, still shivering as the flames have burnt out.\nNow the princess can not stop the prince from marrying her. As they drive off to church, the evil Queen sends her soldiers after them to stop them. The servant with the amazing sense of hearing hears her plan and tells the others. The obese servant spits out all the water he had drunk before, drowning all the soldiers. A next legion of soldiers is stopped by the servant with the amazing eyesight looking at them and shooting them to smithereens. After that, the marriage is held without any further problems and all the servants go their own separate ways.\nReturning to his kingdom, the prince lies to his bride that he is actually a swineherd. He forces his bride to work in extreme poverty and misery for eight days, causing her to believe it is what she deserved for being so proud and haughty. Then she is brought to the palace, where the prince reveals it was all just a ploy to have her suffer just as much for him as he did for her. Then they marry as prince and princess and live happily ever after.\n\n\n"

    "name": "One-inch boy",
    "plot": "\nThe general story is:\n\nA childless old couple prayed to the Sumiyoshi sanjin to be blessed with a child, and so they were able to have one. However, the child born was only one sun (around 3 cm or 1.2 in) in height and never grew taller. Thus, the child was named the \"one-sun boy\" or \"Issun-b\u014dshi\".\nOne day, Issun-b\u014dshi said he wanted to go the capital to become a warrior, so he embarked on his voyage with a bowl as a boat, a chopstick as a paddle, a needle as a sword, and a piece of straw as a scabbard. In the capital, he found a splendid big house and found employment there. When a girl of that family went on a journey to visit a palace, an oni kidnapped the girl. As Issun-b\u014dshi attempted to save the girl, the oni swallowed him up. Issun-b\u014dshi used the needle to stab at the oni in the stomach, making the oni surrender, saying \"it hurts, stop.\" The oni spat Issun-b\u014dshi back out before fleeing to the mountains.\nIssun-b\u014dshi picked up the magic hammer (Uchide no kozuchi) dropped by the oni and swung it to enlarge his body to a height of six shaku (about 182 cm or 6 ft) and married the girl. It is said that he was able to use that mallet to conjure food, treasures, and other things, and the family was able to prosper for generations.However, the version of the story written in the Otogi-z\u014dshi has a few differences:\n\nThe old couple was disturbed by how Issun-b\u014dshi never grew larger and thought he was some kind of monster. As a result, Issun-b\u014dshi left their house.\nThe place where Issun-b\u014dshi lived in the capital was a chancellor's home.\nIssun-b\u014dshi fell in love with the chancellor's daughter at first sight and wanted to make her his wife. However, he felt that with such a small body, she would not marry him, so he thought out a plan. He brought some of the rice grains offered to the family altar and put them in the girl's mouth, and then took an empty teabag and pretended to cry. When the chancellor saw this, Issun-b\u014dshi lied and said that the girl stole some rice that he had been storing, and the chancellor believed this and attempted to kill his daughter. Issun-b\u014dshi mediated between them and left the house together with the daughter.\nThe boat that they rode on went with the wind and landed on an eerie island. There, they encountered an oni, and the oni swallowed Issun-b\u014dshi whole. However, Issun-b\u014dshi took advantage of his small body and went out of the oni's body through its eye. This repeated several times until the oni was frustrated and withdrew, leaving the magic hammer behind.\nThe rumors of Issun-b\u014dshi spread throughout society and he was summoned to the palace. The emperor took a liking to Issun-b\u014dshi, and raised him to the rank of Ch\u016bnagon.A version where Issun-b\u014dshi strategized to marry a rich person's daughter is recorded in the Shinkoku Gudo Zuihitsu of the Edo period. Other documents record similar tales:\nAs a result of framing the daughter, Issun-b\u014dshi was left in charge of her. Another theory is that by putting a suitor's food into's one's mouth, a person accepts that man's proposal.\nThe boy who became betrothed used the magic hammer to grow himself into a taller man and married the girl. Some versions may be missing a theme of making a strategy or plan with regards to the girl.\nSome versions might only have the part about beating the oni and not about making such strategies or growing larger.There are also many differences in the tale depending on the region where it is told.\n\n\n"

These include the thunder man (Donnermann), the wind bride (Windliesel), the cloud woman (Wolkenfrau), the lightning witch (Blitzhexe), Rainy Fritz (Regenfritz), the gale giant (Sturmriese), Hail Hans (Hagelhans), Mother Hulda (Frau Holle), Ice Max (Eismax), the vodyanoy (Wassermann), Mary-of-the-dew (Taumariechen), morning glory (Morgenr\u00f6te), the afterglow (Abendr\u00f6te), the morning star (Morgenstern) and the evening star (Abendstern) and the Queen of the Day (die Sonne). The Guardian of the Milky Way appears and complains about the chaos caused by the guests travelling to the meeting. The guests apologize and offer the guardian gifts.\nSandman and the adventurers arrive, surprising the guests as he is never usually late and by bringing humans. Mr. Zoomzeman's sad story prompts the celestial spirits to offer help. The Night Fairy asks the Guardian of the Milky Way to summon the Great Bear. Peter, Anneli and Mr. Zoomzeman are carried by the bear to the Moon cannon, via a meadow where gifts and sweets are grown for Christmas and past the nest where a hen lays colourful Easter eggs. The cannon fires the adventurers up onto a hill where the lost sixth leg is nailed to a sacred birch tree.\nAt the tree the heroes are confronted by the Man in the Moon, a cruel, violent cannibal. In the fight to prevent the children from being eaten the celestial spirits attack the Man in the Moon and Peter battles with his wooden toy sword. Anneli summons her and Peter's stars, who blind the Man in the Moon. The evil giant cannot see and gets lost in the deep moon woods.\nLittle Peter retrieves the sixth leg and Anneli attaches it to the unconscious beetle. Mr. Zoomzeman wakes and is delighted, but they must return to Earth immediately to avoid being stuck on the Moon forever. He uses an old charm which creates a hole. The children jump into the hole and fall back into their bedroom on Earth.\nDawn breaks and the children open the window to let Mr. Zoomzeman fly away. Their mother enters the bedroom bringing a gift of gingerbread from Father Christmas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

    "name": "The Red Shoes",
    "plot": "At a performance by the Ballet Lermontov at Covent Garden Opera House, music student Julian is in attendance to hear the ballet score Heart of Fire, composed by his teacher, Professor Palmer. Separately present is Victoria 'Vicky' Page, a young, unknown dancer from an aristocratic background, with her aunt, Lady Neston. As Heart of Fire progresses, Julian recognises the music as one of his own compositions. During the performance, Professor Palmer receives an invitation to an after-ballet party at Lady Neston's residence, also asking Boris Lermontov, the company impresario, to attend. Julian leaves the performance in disillusionment at his professor's plagiarism of his music. Lermontov and Vicki meet, and he invites her to a rehearsal of the company.\nJulian has written to Lermontov to explain the circumstances behind Heart of Fire, but then tries to retrieve the letter. Lermontov's assistant Dimitri thwarts all attempts by Julian to gain entry to Lermontov's suite, but finally Lermontov gives Julian an audience. Julian says that he wishes to retrieve his letter before Lermontov has seen it, except that Lermontov has already read the letter. Lermontov asks Julian to play one of his own works at the piano. After hearing Julian play, he hires him as a r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur for the company orchestra and assistant to the company's conductor, Livingstone Montague (known colloquially to the company as 'Livy'). Lermontov realises that Julian was the true composer of Heart of Fire.\nJulian and Vicky arrive for work at the Ballet Lermontov on the same day. Later, Vicky dances with Ballet Rambert in a matinee performance of Swan Lake at the Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate, in a production with a company led by Marie Rambert (who appears in the film as herself in a wordless cameo). Watching this performance, Lermontov realises her potential and invites Vicky to go with Ballet Lermontov to Paris and Monte Carlo. He decides to create a starring role for her in a new ballet, The Ballet of the Red Shoes, for which Julian is to provide the music.\nThe Ballet of the Red Shoes is a resounding success and Lermontov revitalizes the company's repertoire with Vicky in the lead roles and Julian tasked with composing new scores. In the meantime, Vicky and Julian have fallen in love, but keep their relationship secret from Lermontov. Lermontov begins to have personal feelings toward Vicky; he resents the romance between her and Julian after learning of it. The impresario fires Julian; Vicky leaves the company with him. They marry and live in London, where Julian works on composing a new opera.\nSome time later whilst travelling, Vicky receives a visit from Lermontov, who convinces her to return to the company to dance a revival of The Ballet of the Red Shoes. On opening night, Julian appears in her dressing room; he has left the premi\u00e8re of his opera at Covent Garden to find her and take her back. Lermontov arrives; he and Julian contend for Vicky's affections, each one arguing that her true destiny is with him only. Torn between her love for Julian and her need to dance, she eventually chooses the latter.\nJulian, realising that he has lost her, leaves for the railway station; Lermontov consoles Vicky and tries to turn her attention to the evening's performance. Vicky is escorted to the stage wearing the red shoes and, seemingly under their influence, turns and runs from the theatre. Julian, on the platform of the railway station, runs towards her. Vicky leaps from a balcony and falls in front of an approaching train, which hits her. Whether this is suicide or murder (by the red shoes) is left ambiguous. Shortly after, a shaken Lermontov appears before the audience to announce that, \"Miss Page is unable to dance tonight\u2014nor indeed any other night\". As a mark of respect, the company performs The Ballet of the Red Shoes with a spotlight on the empty space where Vicky would have been. As Vicky bleeds to death on a stretcher, she asks Julian to remove the red shoes, just as at the end of the ballet.\n\n\n"

Soon afterwards, she became pregnant and gave birth to a girl with a snake wrapped about her neck; the midwives were frightened, but the snake slithered off into the garden without harming anyone.\nThe girl was named Biancabella. When she turned ten, the snake spoke to her in the garden, telling her that she was her sister, Samaritana, and that if Biancabella obeyed her, she would be happy but miserable if she did not. The snake then ordered her to bring two buckets, one of milk and one of rosewater. When Biancabella returned to the house, she was distressed so her mother asked her what made her so sad. Biancabella asked for the buckets, which her mother gave her, and she carried them into the garden. The snake then had Biancabella bathe in the buckets. She became even more beautiful, and when her hair was combed it shed jewels, and when her hands were washed, they shed flowers.\nThis attracted many suitors. Finally, her father agreed to marry her to Ferrandino, King of Naples. After the wedding, Biancabella called on Samaritana, but the snake did not come to her. Biancabella realized she must have disobeyed her and grieved for the snake, but left with her husband. Ferrandino's stepmother, who wanted to marry him to one of her ugly daughters, was enraged. Some time later, Ferrandino had to go to war; while he was gone, his stepmother ordered her servants to take Biancabella away and kill her, bringing back proof of her death. They took her away, and while they did not kill her, they gouged out her eyes and cut off her hands. The stepmother gave word that her own daughters had died, and that the queen had miscarried and was ill; then, she put her own daughter into Biancabella's bed. Ferrandino, returning, was greatly distressed.\nBiancabella called on Samaritana, who still did not come. An old man brought her to his home; his wife rebuked him, because she had doubtlessly been punished for some crime, but he insisted. Biancabella asked one of his three daughters to comb her hair; the old woman did not want her daughter to be a servant, but the girl obeyed and jewels came out of Biancabella's hair. The family was greatly pleased because she had delivered them from poverty. After a time, Biancabella asked the old man to bring her back to where she had been found, and there she called on Samaritana until she finally thought of killing herself. Samaritana appeared to stop her, and Biancabella appealed for forgiveness.  Samaritana restored her eyes and hands, and then herself transformed into a woman.\nAfter a time, the sisters, the old man and woman, and their daughters went to Naples, where Samaritana built them a house magically. Ferrandino saw the women, and they told him that they had been exiled and had come there to live. He brought the women of court, including his stepmother, to the castle, where Samaritana told a servant to sing Biancabella's story without including the names. Then she asked what would be a fitting punishment. The stepmother, thinking to evade notice, said she should be cast into a red-hot furnace. Samaritana told the king the truth; Ferrandino ordered the stepmother to be thrown into a furnace, married off the old man's three daughters well, and lived happily with Biancabella until he died, and his son succeeded him.\n\n\n"

Rowland kicked the ball over the church and Burd Ellen went to retrieve it, inadvertently circling the church \"widdershins\", or opposite the way of the sun, and disappeared. Rowland went to Merlin to ask what became of his sister and was told that she was taken to the Dark Tower by the King of Elfland, and only the boldest knight in Christendom could retrieve her.\nThe eldest brother decided he would make the journey, and was told what to do by Merlin. He did not return, and the middle brother followed, only to meet the same fate. Finally Childe Rowland went forth, having been given his father's sword, which never struck in vain, for protection. Merlin gave him his orders: he must chop off the head of anyone in Elfland who speaks to him until he sees his sister, and he must not eat or drink anything while in that realm. Rowland obeyed the orders, dispatching a horseherd, a cowherd, and a henwife, who would not tell him where his sister was. The henwife would only say he had to circle a hill three times widdershins, and say each time \"Open, door! open, door! And let me come in.\" Following the instructions, a door opened in the hill and Rowland entered a great hall, where sat Burd Ellen, under the spell of the King of Elfland. She told him he should not have entered Elfland, for misfortune befell all who did, including their brothers, who were prisoners in the Dark Tower, nearly dead.\nRowland, forgetting Merlin's words, was overcome with hunger and asked his sister for food. Unable to warn him, she complied. At the last moment, Merlin's words returned to Rowland and he threw down the food, upon which the King of Elfland burst into the hall. Rowland fought with the King, and with the aid of his father's sword beat him into submission. The King begged for mercy, and Rowland granted it, provided his siblings were released. They returned home together, and Burd Ellen never circled the church widdershins again.\nIn the version given by F.A. Steel in her English Fairy Tales, originally published in 1918 (republished by Macmillan in 2016), when Rowland finds Burd Helen, or at least an enchanted version of her, and she speaks to him, he remembers Merlin's instructions and cuts her head off, which brings back the real Burd Helen. This explains why the first two brothers had not returned; they could not bring themselves to cut off her head, and had become enchanted themselves.\n\n\n"

The girl is reluctant, so the peasant asks the bear to return, and in the meantime, persuades her.  The White Bear takes her off to a rich and enchanted castle.  At night, he takes off his bear form in order to come to her bed as a man, although the lack of light means that she never sees him.\n\nWhen she grows homesick, the bear agrees that she might go home as long as she agrees that she will never speak with her mother alone, but only when other people are about.  At home, they welcome her, and her mother makes persistent attempts to speak with her alone, finally succeeding and persuading her to tell the whole tale.  Hearing it, her mother insists that the White Bear must really be a troll, gives her some candles, and tells her to light them at night, to see what is sharing her bed.\nThe youngest daughter obeys, and finds he is a highly attractive prince, but she spills three drops of the melted tallow on him, waking him.  He tells her that if she held out a year, he would have been free, but now he must go to his wicked stepmother, who enchanted him into this shape and lives in a castle east of the Sun and west of the Moon, and marry her hideous daughter, a troll princess.\nIn the morning, the youngest daughter finds that the palace has vanished.  She sets out in search of him.  Coming to a great mountain, she finds an old woman playing with a golden apple.  The youngest daughter asks if she knows the way to the castle east of the Sun and west of the Moon.  The old woman cannot tell her, but lends the youngest daughter a horse to reach a neighbor who might know, and gives her the apple.  The neighbor is sitting outside another mountain, with a golden carding comb.  She, also, does not know the way to the castle east of the Sun and west of the Moon, but lends the youngest daughter a horse to reach a neighbor who might know, and gives her the carding-comb.  The third neighbor has a golden spinning wheel.

The North Wind reports that he once blew an aspen leaf there, and was exhausted after, but he will take her if she really wants to go.  The youngest daughter does wish to go, and so he takes her there.\nThe next morning, the youngest daughter takes out the golden apple.  The troll princess who was to marry the prince sees it and wants to buy it.  The girl agrees, if she can spend the night with the prince.  The troll princess agrees but gives the prince a sleeping drink, so that the youngest daughter cannot wake him. The same thing happens the next night, after the youngest daughter pays the troll princess with the gold carding-combs.  During the girl's attempts to wake the prince, her weeping and calling to him is overheard by some imprisoned townspeople in the castle, who tell the prince of it.  On the third night, in return for the golden spinning wheel, the troll princess brings the drink, but the prince does not drink it, and so is awake for the youngest daughter's visit.\nThe prince tells her how she can save him:  He will declare that he will marry anyone who can wash the tallow drops from his shirt since trolls, such as his stepmother and her daughter, the troll princess, cannot do it. So instead, he will call in the youngest daughter, and she will be able to do it, so she will marry him.  The plan works, and the trolls, in a rage, burst.  The prince and his bride free the prisoners captive in the castle, take the gold and silver within, and leave the castle east of the Sun and west of the Moon.\n\n\n"

The queen resolved that she could make nets, with which the king could catch birds and fish to support them.  As for their three daughters, they were useless; the king should take them somewhere and leave them there.\nTheir youngest, Finette, heard this and went to her fairy godmother.  She became tired on the way and sat down to cry.  A jennet appeared before her, and she begged it to carry her to her godmother.  Her godmother gave her a ball of thread that, if she tied to the house door, would lead her back, and a bag with gold and silver dresses.\nThe next day, their mother led them off and urged them to go to sleep in a meadow.  Then she left.  Though her sisters were cruel to her, Finette woke them.  The sisters promised her many things if she would lead them, and they made their way back.  Their mother pretended she had left to get something else.  Her sisters blamed Finette, gave her nothing they had promised, and beat her.  The queen resolved to lead them away further, so Finette visited her godmother again.  Her godmother told her this time to bring a sack of ashes and use it to make footprints, but she should not bring her sisters back, and she would never see her godmother again if she did.  The queen led them off, her sisters bewailed their fate, and Finette had pity on them.  The king and queen plotted for a third time, and the middle sister said they could leave peas for their path, but Finette brought her jewelry and the bag of clothing instead.  When the queen abandoned them, pigeons had eaten their peas, and they could not return.\nFinette found an acorn and refused to let them eat it; instead, they planted it.  They ate cabbages and lettuce.  The acorn grew into a tree and Finette climbed it.  One day, her sisters looked into her bag and found her jewelry; they stole it and put stones in its place.  After this, one day Finette saw from the tree a dazzling castle.  Her sisters stole her clothing and jewelry and left her in rags when they went to it.  A hideous and enormous old woman told them that it was an ogre's castle.  She told them she would let them live a few days; they tried to flee but she caught them.  The ogre returned, and she hid them so she could eat them herself.  He smelled them, and she persuaded him to keep them to look after the castle, so she could eat them while he was gone.  While they were at work, Finette tricked the ogre into the oven and burned him to cinders.  Then she persuaded the ogress that if she let them dress her and do her hair, she would soon find a noble husband.  While she was doing the hair, she cut off the ogress's head.\nHer sisters dressed themselves in the treasures of the castle and, so they might find husbands, went off to show themselves in the nearest town, threatening to beat her if the castle was not perfectly kept.  They came back with tales of dancing with the king's son and kept going and leaving her behind.  One day, Finette found an old key, and it proved to be gold and to open a chest full of beautiful clothing.  When her sisters left, she dressed herself and followed to the ball, where she called herself Cendron and everyone paid court to her.\nFor many days, this went on; the chest always produced new clothing.  But one day, Finette left in a hurry because she had to get back before her sisters, and she left behind a red velvet slipper, embroidered with pearls.  The king's oldest son found it and fell ill.  No doctor could cure him.  He said he had fallen in love with the woman whose shoe it was, so they ordered all the women to appear and try it on.  Her sisters went, but Finette did not know the way.  She dressed herself and found the jennet at her door again.  She rode past her sisters, splashing them with mud.  When she put on the slipper, the prince wanted to marry her, but Finette insisted that the king, who was the one who had conquered her parents' kingdom, restore it to them, first.  They agreed.  She married off her sisters and sent back to the jennet with gifts for her fairy godmother.\n\n\n"

That night, the youngest princess woke to find herself in a grand hall, and a handsome prince on his knees before her, asking her to marry him. They were married at once, and the prince explained that a witch had transformed him into a bear to get him to marry her daughter. Now that she had married him, he would be freed if she endured five years of trials.\nThey had three children in succession, but an eagle, a greyhound, and a lady took each one, and the princess, after losing the last child, told her husband that she wanted to visit her family. He told her that to return, she had only to wish it while lying down at night, and the next morning, she would wake in her old bed. She told her family her tale, and while she did not want to lose any more children, she was certain it was not her husband's fault, and she missed him. A woman told her to burn his bear fur, and then he would have to be a man both night and day. She stopped drinking a drink he gave her before she went to bed, and woke up and burned his fur. The man woke and told her that now he had to marry a witch's daughter; it had been the witch who had given her that advice.\nThe princess chased after her husband, and just as the night fell, they both reached a little house. A little boy played before the hearth, and her husband told her that the boy was their son, and the woman whose house it was, was the eagle who had carried the boy away. The woman made them welcome, and her husband gave her a pair of scissors, that would turn anything they cut into silk. He told her he would forget her during the day, but remember at night. At the second night, they found a house with their daughter, and he gave her a comb that would make pearls and diamonds fall from her hair.\nAt the third night, they found a house with their third child, and he gave her a hand-reel with golden thread that has no end, and half their wedding ring. He told her that once he entered a wood the next day, he would forget her and the children utterly, unless she reached his home and put her half of the ring to his. The wood tried to keep her out, but she commanded it, by the gifts she bore, to let her in, and found a great house and a woodman's cottage nearby. She went to the cottage and persuaded the woodman and his wife to take her as their servant, saying she would take no wages, but give them silk, diamonds, pearls, and golden thread whenever they wanted. She heard that a prince had come to live at the witch's castle.\nThe servants at the castle annoyed her with their attentions. She invited the head footman, the most persistent, and asked him to pick her some honeysuckle; when he did, she used the gifts she bore to give him horns and make him sing back to the great house. His fellow servants made mock of him until she let the charm drop. The prince, having heard of this, went to look at her and was puzzled by the sight. The witch's daughter came and saw the scissors, and the princess would only exchange them for a night outside the prince's chamber. She took the night and could not wake the prince, and the head footman ridiculed her as he put her out again. She tried again, with the comb, to no better success.\nThe third day, the prince did not merely look at her but stopped to ask if he could do anything for her, and she asked if he heard anything in the night. He said he had thought he heard singing in his dreams. She asked him if he had drunk anything before he slept, and when he said he had, she asked him to not drink it. That night, bargained for with the reel, she sang, and the prince roused. The princess was able to put the half-rings together, and he regained his memory. The castle fell apart, and the witch and her daughter vanished. The prince and the princess soon regained their children and set out for their own castle.\n\n\n"

He took a stick and whittled it, so it was whiter than his brothers' horses, and rode off on it.\nThe eleven brothers came to a house where a woman told them they could not only stay for the night, they could each have one of her daughters. They were pleased. Esben came up behind them and sneaked about. In the night, he had his brothers change caps with the girls.

Sir Red decided to revenge himself by saying they had said they could get the king a dove with a silver feather and a golden one. The king demanded it of them. Esben told them to get him some peas, then he recited a charm to his stick, and it flew him back to the witch's. He had noticed she had such a dove; he spread the peas and caught it.

The witch called to her daughter to make her porridge and add no salt, so Esben poured salt into it. There was no water in the house, so the daughter asked her mother for the lamp to fetch more. Esben then pushed her into the well and she drowned, and he ran off with the lamp.\nAfter the king received it, Sir Red made a new claim, about a coverlet (bed cover) that sounded when touched. The boy tried to steal it, but it sounded and the witch caught him. But her last and youngest daughter took a liking to him, and together they twice tricked her mother into having him live in captivity. Eventually, when the witch had to go to a meeting of witches, Esben pushed the final girl in the oven and stole the coverlet. After all of her offspring have been destroyed, the returning witch was so furious she burst into small pieces of flint.\nHis brothers were already in prison to be executed, but the king freed them. Esben also told him about Sir Red, and the king hanged him and rewarded all the brothers with gold and silver, and they returned home, telling their father how Esben had saved them.\n\n\n"

    "name": "The Witch in the Stone Boat",
    "plot": "A king told his son Sigurd to marry, recommending a daughter of another king as prospective wife. Sigurd traveled to that kingdom and made his marriage proposal, and the bride's king agreed to the match, on condition that Sigurd would stay and help him as long as he could. Sigurd promised to remain, until such time as he received news of his father's death. When Sigurd learned of his father's death, he set sail for his homeland with his wife and their two-year-old son.\nThe ship was one day short of completing its journey when the wind died down. Sigurd was overcome with drowsiness and left the queen and his child alone on the deck. There approached a stone boat carrying a frightening \"witch\" (Lang. tr.) or \"troll-wife\" (Icelandic: tr\u00f6llkona). The witch boarded ship, snatched away the baby and assumed the queen's place by transforming into her likeness and wearing the fine clothes she stripped from the queen. The imposter put the real queen on the stone boat, and spoke incantations to the boat telling it to go without straying to her brother in the underworld. The boat shot off and was soon out of sight from the ship. The disappearance of the real mother made the baby cry uncontrollably, and the witch's effort to quiet it was to no avail. So the witch went beneath deck and scolded Sigurd for leaving her alone on the deck. Such temper tantrum was something Sigurd had never received from his wife, and it surprised him, but he thought she had an excusable reason this time. But for all the efforts of the two of them, they could not stop the boy from crying.\n\nSigurd was now the ruler of his homeland, succeeding his dead father. The little boy who used to be such a quiet child hardly stopped crying since that day, so he had to be given up to be raised by a wet nurse (or foster mother fostr\u00e1), one of the court ladies. Sigurd noticed his wife's change in temperament: she was now more \"haughty and stubborn, and difficult to deal with\".\nBut the fake queen's identity was to unravel. Two young courtiers who were in the habit of playing chess (actually Tafl games)in the room next to the queen eavesdropped and spied on her through a crack. They heard her say that the more widely she yawned, the more she transformed back into a troll, and even as she spoke, she gave a huge yawn, and reverted into the form of a hideous troll-wife. And through the floor of her room appeared her brother, a three-headed giant (\u00fer\u00edh\u00f6f\u00f0a\u00f0ur \u00feussi), who brought her a trough full of meat, which she devoured.Meanwhile, the boy-prince's wet nurse was about to witness the supernatural appearance of the true queen. When the wet nurse turned the [candle-]light on, several planks from the floor rose up, and from underneath appeared an astonishingly beautiful white-clad woman, dressed in linen. Clasped around her waist was an iron belt, with a chain leading down into the ground below. The queen embraced the child for a moment, and returned under the floor again. Her appearance was repeated the second night, and the nurse heard the queen say lamentfully that \"Two are gone, and one only is left,\" which the nurse guessed must mean that the third night would be her final appearance.\nThe next night, King Sigurd was in the nurse's room with a drawn sword in hand, awaiting the woman, whom he instantly recognized as his own wife. He cut the chain in two and great noises came from beneath the earth. The true queen now told her story. The three-headed giant had tried to force her to marry him (actually, to sleep with him), and at last she consented provided she could visit her son for three consecutive days, hoping for an opportunity to be liberated. The giant must have plummeted to death, the crashing \"caused by him in his death throes\". The real queen was then restored to all her dignity, and the king had the false queen immediately captured and stoned to death, her body torn apart by horses.\n\n\n"

Misinterpreting her, he declared to the third that she did not love him at all and that it was not enough, and hence drove her out.  She made herself a garment of rushes, to wear over her fine clothing, and found a great house where she begged a job scrubbing the dishes, and because she gave them no name, they called her \"Cap-o'-Rushes.\"\nOne day, the servants all went to look at the fine people at a ball.  Cap-o'-Rushes said she was too tired, but when they were gone, she took off her rushes and went to the ball.  Her master's son fell in love with her, but she slipped off.  This repeated two more nights, but the third night, he gave her a ring and said he would die without her.  There were no more balls, and the master's son took to his bed.  They sent orders to the cook to make him some gruel, and Cap-o'-Rushes pleaded until the cook let her make it instead.  She slid the ring into the gruel.\nThe master's son sent for the cook and demanded to know who had made the gruel, and then summoned Cap-o'-Rushes, and questioned her until she admitted she was the woman and took off her rushes.  They were married, and Cap-o'-Rushes ordered that the wedding feast be prepared without any salt.  This left all the dishes without flavour, and her father, who was a guest, burst into tears because he finally realised what his daughter had meant, and now he feared she was dead.

The king told Conall that he could save his sons if he stole the brown horse of the king of Lochlann.  Conall told him that he would steal the horse to please the king, even if his sons were in no danger.  His wife lamented that he had not rather let the king kill his sons than endanger himself.\nConall went with his sons to Lochlann, and there he told them to seek out the king's miller.  They stayed with him, and Conall bribed the miller to put him and his sons in the sacks of bran he delivered to the king.  In the stables, Conall had his sons make hiding holes before they tried to steal the horse.  When they tried, it kept making such noise that the servants would come.  They would hide, but in time, the king realized that there were men in the stables, and found Conall and his sons.\nConall told his story, and because he had had to steal it, the king said he would not hang him, but he would hang his sons.  He told Conall that if he were ever in a worse situation than his sons, and told him the story, he would give Conall his youngest son.\nConall told of a time when he went to get a cow and its calf with his servant, and they met with cats.  The head bard among them told cat after cat to sing a cronan to Conall, and demanded that he pay a reward for it.  First he had to give the calf, then the cow, then (in Campbell's version) the servant, and finally the cats went after him.  He got up a tree and killed a cat that came after him, but the cats dug at the tree's roots.  Fortunately a priest was traveling with delving men and heard the noise, and they came to his rescue.\nThe king told him he had won his youngest son, and if he could tell him of a still harder case, he would give him his next youngest son.  Conall told of a time that he followed some smoke and fell into a giant's cave.  It threatened to kill him, but it was blind in one eye, and Conall said he could cure that eye, and blinded it in the other instead.  In the morning, the giant ordered him to free the goats.  Conall killed one and in its hide escaped with the rest.  The giant realized this and offered him a ring for his stalwartness.  Conall told it to throw it to the ground and he would take it; he did, and it called to the giant when he called to it, and Conall could not take it off.  He cut off his finger and threw it into the sea, and when it called back to the giant, the giant followed it and drowned.  Conall took all its gold and silver and offered as proof that he was in fact missing a finger.\nThe king told him he had won his next youngest son, and if he could tell him of a still harder case, he would give him his (next) oldest son.  Conall told him that he was married, but went to sea and found a woman trying to slit the throat of a baby by a cauldron.  He asked her, and she told him that the giant there would kill her if she did not.  He managed to trick the giant but the giant caught him, and Conall barely managed to kill him in time.\nThe king's mother was listening to this, and told him that she had been the woman and he had been the baby, so Conall had saved his life.  The king gave him the horse, gold and silver, and all the lives of his sons.\n\n\n"

    "name": "How the Devil Married Three Sisters",
    "plot": "The following version was given by Widter and Wolf (Thomas Frederic Crane tr.):Once, the Devil decided to marry. He prepared a house, disguised himself as a fine gentleman, and came calling on a family to woo their three daughters. The oldest agreed to marry him.  When he took her home, he forbade her to look in a door, but as soon as he left, she did so, and hellfire in the door singed the little flower bouquet that she wore on her bosom. She could not hide what had happened, so the Devil said her curiosity would be satisfied, and threw her into hell. A few months later, he wooed the second daughter, but the same fate befell her as her sister.\nThen he came to woo the youngest daughter, Margerita. She was a clever one, and suspected he had murdered her sisters, but the match was so good, it would have been a challenge to find one better. When administered the same test, she too was overcome by curiosity and opened the forbidden door, making the discovery that hell lay beyond it, that her sisters were there, and the man she wedded was the Devil. Margerita pulled out her two sisters and hid them away. By happenstance, she had placed her flower in water and it remained unscathed by fire, so her action went undetected. The Devil, reassured when he saw her flowers still fresh, came to love her unconditionally.\nHatching an escape plan, Margerita asked the Devil to carry each of three chests to her parents, making him promise never to put it down along the way. She said she will be watching. The Devil was tempted to unload the chest, but every time he was stopped by a voice that cried \"Don't put it down; I see you!\" although the shouting had really come from the first sister he was carrying inside the chest. It was a marvel to the Devil that his wife could see so far, and around corners even. The second sister was smuggled out in the same fashion on the back of the duped Devil. The third chest was for Margerita herself to be concealed inside. A dummy posing as her was affixed to the balcony (poggiolo) as if to keep watch, after which the maid helped load the chest upon the Devil's back. The Devil delivered the burden with even more exertion this time, thinking she was on the lookout from higher ground this time.\nAfter returning, the Devil called out for Margerita, but his wife was nowhere to greet him. Spotting the figure on the balcony, he told her to come down, protesting of dog-like weariness (\"stracco da can\") and wolf-like hunger (\"una fame da lov\"). Then he dashed up and struck her hard in the ear, only to discover it to be a dummy made of rags, with a fake head which was only a hatmaker's mold. Searching the house, he found her jewel box ransacked. He hurried off to his in-laws' house and there found his three wives alive and laughing scornfully at him, and the thought of three at once made him flee.\nSince then, the Devil has lost the appetite to ever marry again.\n\n\n"

An old, humpbacked shepherd saw him and asked him why; the younger brother said it was to straighten out his back, and persuaded the shepherd to be tied there in his place.  Then he drove off the sheep.  He persuaded a horse boy and a driver of oxen to come with him.  He played many tricks and became famous.\nThe king captured him, said he had earned death, and promised to spare him if he brought him the dragon's flying horse.  He went and tried three times to steal the horse.  Each time it neighed, alerting the dragon, but the third time the dragon, annoyed at being awoken, beat the horse.  The fourth time, the horse did not neigh, the boy led him out, and once out, he mounted and rode off, taunting the dragon.\nThe king then demanded the dragon's bed coverings.  The boy went and tried to hook the blanket during the night, but the dragon said his wife was hogging them, and pulled them, pulling the boy down.  The dragon tied him and told his wife to cook him the next day while he went to church.  When he returned, they would eat him.  The dragoness untied him to cut his throat more easily, and the boy cut her throat and threw her into the oven.  He stole the bedcoverings and returned to the king.\nThe king then demanded the dragon itself.  The boy demanded two years to let his beard grow as a disguise, and the king agreed.  When the two years were up, the youth changed clothing with a beggar and found the dragon making a box, in order to trap him in it.  The youth said that the box was too small.  The dragon assured him that it was big enough even for himself and wriggled in to show him.  The youth clapped on the top and told him to see if the youth would be able to escape.  The dragon tried as hard as it could, and could not get out.\nThe youth brought him back to the king.  The king wanted to see the dragon.  He was careful enough to open a hole too small for the dragon to escape, but not enough to keep it from biting him and swallowing him whole.  The youth married the king's daughter and became king in his place.\n\n\n"

His mother offers him half a hen and half a cake with her blessing, or the whole of both without; he asks for the halves and is given the whole of both, with her blessing.

A dog (Coley) runs up to him for protection, with a pot tied to its tail and a crowd hunting it; the donkey bellows and scares them off and Jack unties the pot.  He shares his meal with the dog, while the donkey eats thistles; a half-starved cat (Tom) comes by, and Jack gives it a bone with meat.  In the evening, they rescue a rooster from a fox. (The rooster is referred to as Irish: Cuileach Dhu or \"Black Cock\").\nThey go to sleep in the woods.  The rooster crows, claiming to see dawn, and Jack realises that it's a candle in a house.  They spy a look inside, and discover it to be a robbers' den.  With the donkey placing its fore-hoofs on the window-sill, the animals stack one on top of another and make noise, then, at Jack's deceptive call to raise the pistols and fire, the beasts smash all the window panes, frightening the robbers into bolting the house and riding far out into the woods.  Jack and the animals enter the house, enjoy a meal, and go to sleep.  After a while, the captain of the robbers sorely misses the loot he left behind. So he sneaks back inside the house in the dark, only to receive scratches from the cat, a bite from the dog, pecking from the rooster, and finally a great kick from the donkey at the stable outside. The captain (who could see nothing in the dark) weaves a fancifully horrid account of what happened, adding that not all the plaster in Enniscorthy would heal the cuts and wounds he received, and the other robbers lose all craving of trying to retrieve their loot.\nJack and comrades resolve next day to return the stolen gold to its owner, and journey to the manor of the Lord of Dunlavin. Jack is halted at the door by the crooked porter. Jack and the rest know from the thieves' conversation the night before that this porter was in league with the thieves, and complicit in the crime. The rooster makes a sarcastic remark, plainly accusing the porter of giving the thieves free passage through the door to his master's house, and the porter's face turns completely crimson.  The interchange is witnessed by the Lord of Dunlavin, who, addressing the porter by name (Barney), prods him to answer the charge, and the porter replies \"sure I didn't open the door to the six robbers,\" thus betraying his own familiarity with the perpetrators.\nJack announces that, no matter, he has arrived with the stolen gold and silver, and requested a supper and lodging after a long ride from Athsalach ('muddy ford'). The grateful lord declares he would provide them comfort for the rest of their days, appointing Jack as his steward, brought his mother to live near the castle, and eventually married his lordship's daughter.\n\n\n"

The Devil ordered him to clean the fire irons with his bare hands.  Jean told Eulalie she might as well have let him be eaten at once.  Eulalie, on his promise to marry her and carry her away, agreed to get the hot irons cleaned, which she accomplished using her magic wand.  The next day, the Devil told him to clean the horse trappings; Eulalie got Jean to repeat his promise and cleaned them for him.

The Devil's wife had a vision of the young couple running away in her dream, and woke her husband. But when the Devil shouted Jean and Eulalie's names, the pies answered back.

Eulalie warned not to let anyone kiss him, lest he would lose all memory of Eulalie.  But when he went to bed in his father's house, his mother came to him while asleep and kissed him.  When he woke, he no longer recognized Eulalie, and she had to leave.  With her wand, she conjured herself a castle and lived in it.  Three servants at a nearby castle decided to meet her.  The oldest came and begged a night's lodging, and Eulalie asked him to tend the fire.  But she used her wand to scatter the cinders he collected into a pile, and continued this until morning, so that by the time he left he had burnt fingers.  The next day, the second one asked to stay the night, and Eulalie asked him to close the shutters against the rain.  Then she used the wand to make them flap open each time he closed, repeatedly until morning, so that he left cold and soaking wet.  The third one asked to stay the night.  Eulalia asked him to bolt the door, and then used the wand to release the bolt each time he threw the bolt shut on the door, until he left the next morning, his hand sore.\nAs for Jean, he was about to marry a local girl.

Using the whistle, he kept them together.  The king heard of it and resolved to stop him.  A shabby girl begged for a hare to feed for guests; finally, Jesper agreed to give her one in return for a kiss, but then he whistled it back.  A stout old woman, in peasant dress, came next.  He agreed to give her one if she would tiptoe about him cackling like a hen, and then he whistled it back.  An fat old man in a royal groom's livery came, and Jesper agreed to give him one if he stood on his head, and then whistled it back.\nThe next day, the king set out a tub and said that Jesper must fill it with undoubted truths, and he would judge when that was.  Jesper told about the girl, and that she was the princess; then about the woman, and that she was the queen; then about the old man\u2014and the king declared that the tub was full, so Jesper married the princess, and the king decided he would be a good king if he looked after the people as well as he looked after the hares.\n\n\n"

The third giant realized he was about and caught him.\nThey demanded a service of him.  They wished to carry off the king's daughter, and had put everyone to sleep in the castle except a little black dog.  If he shot the dog so it did not bark and wake everyone, they would spare his life.   They threw him in and he landed on grass.  He shot the dog and went to the gate, but on the way, he saw an enormous sword, a drinking horn, and an inscription saying that whoever drank from the horn could wield the sword.  He looked through the castle and found the princess.  He took half her handkerchief and one of her slippers.  Then he drained the horn and could wield the sword.  He went to the gate, where there was a small door and a large door.  He opened the small door, claimed he was too weak for the large one, and cut off the giants' heads as they came through.  Then he ran to rejoin his family, with his sword.  He shut the door with such a bang that the castle woke.  They were astounded by the bodies.  The princess said they must find the giant-slayer, because she was honor-bound to marry him.  She had a house built, and put over its door that whoever told the story of his life could stay there for nothing.Meanwhile, Niels and his family went on toward Rome, but they met a man who showed them the holes in his shoes, and told them the shoes had been new when he left Rome.  Discouraged, they turned back.  They came upon the house and decided to stay there.  The steward questioned the father and the older son, and told the princess that nothing had happened to them, but admitted he had not asked them all.  The princess went herself.  The older brother put in that he had forgotten to tell that his brother had found a sword.  Niels, who had guessed this was a way to discover him, wanted to escape, but they found the sword, and searched him, finding the handkerchief and slipper. Niels was afraid that they would punish him, but the princess said only they must wait until her father returned.  When he did, the princess married Niels, who was king after the king died.\n\n\n"

    "name": "Nix Nought Nothing",
    "plot": "(Jacobs' modified version, except where otherwise noted\u2014L indicates Lang's text, and J Jacobs' version)\nA queen gave birth to a son while the king was away, and not wanting to christen him until his father returned, decreed that he should be called Nix Nought Nothing (L: Nicht Nought Nothing) until that time.  The king was gone for a long time, and Nix Nought Nothing grew into a boy.  As the king journeyed home, a giant offered to help him over a river in return for \"Nix Nought Nothing,\" and the king, not knowing that he had a son by this name, agreed.  When he learned what he had done, the king tried to give the giant the hen-wife's son, and then the gardener's son, but both of the boys betrayed their origin, and the giant killed them. In the end the royal couple had to give the prince to the giant.\nThe giant had a daughter, and she and the prince grew very fond of each other.  When the prince was grown and the giant sent him to clean the stables, she summoned animals to clean it for him. When the giant sent him to empty a lake (L: loch), she summoned fish to drink it. When the giant commanded him to bring down a bird's nest from a tall tree without breaking any of the eggs, she cut off her fingers and toes to make a stairway, but during that adventure one egg broke. The prince and the giant's daughter decided to flee.  The giant chased after them. The girl had Nix Nought Nothing throw down her comb, which became a brier, and then her hair dagger, which became a hedge of razors, and then she dashed a magic flask, which produced a wave that drowned the giant (L. lacks account of various means by which the daughter thwarted or drowned the giant; presumably the giant died by chance during pursuit. Jacobs' has woven in these details borrowing from other tales, acting upon Lang's suggestions.).\nThe giant's daughter was too weary to go on, and sent Nix Nought Nothing on ahead of her to the king's castle.  But the hen-wife whose son had died cursed him, and he fell into a deep slumber as soon as he arrived at the castle.  The king and queen still did not recognize their grown son, and the king promised that whichever maiden can awaken the sleeping man shall marry him.  (L. Nicht had already been given a head start even before the giant's pursuit began. No mention of  curse or any cause for slumber. Promise for him to marry maiden who wakes him lacking.)\nThe giant's daughter finally arrived at the king's castle, and climbed a tree over a well to watch for the prince.  But when her reflection fell on the surface of the water, the gardener's daughter who came to fetch water mistook the image for her own. She decided she was beautiful enough to be a contender to marry the sleeping stranger.  After learning from the hen-wife a counteracting spell to ward off his sleepiness for as long as she wished, she succeeds in waking the prince for a while, and securing the promised marriage. Meanwhile, the gardener, doing his own water chore, had discovered the giant's daughter up in the tree, and brought her inside his house, breaking the news that his daughter is to marry the stranger, and showed her Nix Nought Nothing.  (L. Gardener' daughter and wife, merely deceived by reflection into thinking they are too bonny to draw water from well. Giant's daughter learns from gardener Nicht's betrothal to king's daughter, i.e. his own sister.)\nThe giant's daughter now sang her imploring charm for her sleeping beloved to awaken, recalling all that she had done for him; it was to no avail. But she called him Nix Nought Nothing, and the king and queen learned that he was their own son.  They made the gardener's daughter remove the spell, executed the hen-wife (J only), and married Nix Nought Nothing to the giant's daughter.\n\n\n"

Finally, however, the moon said her daughter was more beautiful.  She took to her bed and told the man that he must get rid of her daughter and bring her bloody shirt as proof.  Instead of killing the girl, though, the father abandoned Nourie Hadig in the woods.\nNourie Hadig found a house and when she entered it, the door closed behind her.  She found rooms full of treasure and a sleeping prince.  A voice told her to cook food for the prince for seven years, leaving it beside his bed.\nAt the next new moon, the moon told Nourie Hadig's mother her daughter was still more beautiful.  The wife realized that her daughter had not been killed and was determined to find and murder her. The husband admitted that he had not killed Nourie Hadig but did not know where she was; the wife set out to find her.  Every new moon, she asked the moon again about her daughter and heard every time that her daughter was more beautiful.\nAfter four years, gypsies came by the house where Nourie Hadig was.  She bought a girl from them, and they both served the prince.  At the end of the seven years, the prince woke and because the gypsy girl was tending him, he thought she had served him all seven years, so he decided to marry her.  While wedding arrangements were going on, the prince went to town and told Nourie Hadig that since she must have helped some, he would buy her something.  She asked for the Stone of Patience.  He went to buy it.  The stonecutter told him that if one's troubles were great, the stone would swell until it burst from sorrow on hearing them, but if the person made much of a little, the person would swell and burst, and so he must watch and ensure that the servant who asked for it did not burst.  He gave Nourie Hadig the stone, and she told it her story.  It swelled and was about to burst when the prince broke in and insisted on marrying her rather than the gypsy.\nThe next new moon, the moon said that the princess of Adana was more beautiful, so the mother knew where her daughter was.  She had a beautiful ring made that would make the wearer fall asleep and had a witch bring it to her daughter, pleading that she had been out of her mind when she ordered her death.  The gypsy girl persuaded the daughter to wear the ring, and she fell down dead.  The prince refused to bury his wife; he would tend her as she had tended him.  Many doctors were unable to heal her, but one tried to steal the ring.  She started to come awake; he slid it back on and got the prince to promise him rewards for healing his wife. Then he took the ring off, which restored Nourie Hadig to life.\nWhile the ring was on Nourie Hadig's finger, the moon had told the wife that she was the most beautiful one. After the ring was removed, though, it said that Nourie Hadig was. The wife became so angry that she died.\n\n\n"

    "plot": "An aged king who is a widower lavishes indulgence on his only son, who the people consequently call \"Prince Darling.\"  He fears he will die before the child is of age and confesses his concern to his friend, the Fairy of Truth.  The fairy promises to grant the boy a boon such as beauty, wealth or military success, but the king asks only that the fairy make the boy a good person.  The fairy says she cannot change the boy's character, but she can give him advice and correct him when he errs.\nAfter the king's death, the fairy appears to Prince Darling, now the king, and gives him a magic ring that will prick his finger whenever he does wrong.  Prince Darling continues to follow the instructions of his wise old mentor, Suleiman, but begins carousing at night with power-seeking sycophants who encourage his bad behaviour.  Prince Darling meets a young shepherdess and arrogantly announces to her that he will marry her.  Instead of being honoured, the shepherdess refuses because of Prince Darling's wicked reputation.  The sycophants tell him that if he won't punish subjects who disobey him, his power will dissolve and the people will depose him.  By this time Prince Darling has discarded the magic ring because it was almost constantly pricking him.  So he puts the shepherdess in prison to force her consent to the marriage.  When she mysteriously vanishes from her cell, the sycophants accuse Suleiman of freeing her, and that he is trying to undermine Prince Darling's authority and take over the kingdom.  Prince Darling then imprisons Suleiman.\nAt this time the fairy of truth again appears to Prince Darling in a rage, saying that because he did not heed the ring's gentle correction he has become a monster.  She transforms him into a beast with the body of a snake, the legs of a wolf, the head of a lion and the horns of a bull.  The fairy tells him that as ugly as she can make him, his soul is still a hundred times more hideous.  She disappears, and the creature is left alone in the woods to ruminate on the error of his ways.\nThe monster prince is captured by a hunter, who hopes to sell him as a curiosity.  On the way back to the town, they encounter a reveller who says the whole town is rejoicing because Prince Darling is dead.  He says the people have released Suleiman from prison and crowned him as the new king.  Prince Darling sees this as a confirmation of everything his flattering friends said, and roars in rage.  The hunter decides to take the monster to the new king as a coronation gift.\nThe hunter takes the monster prince to the coronation ceremony where they hear Suleiman announce that he is only taking the throne in trust for Prince Darling, who is not dead and will return one day.  The hunter presents the monster to the king, who puts it in his menagerie.  In his cage, Prince Darling observes that the animal keeper is a drunkard who abuses the animals.  Prince Darling reflects that he was wrong about Suleiman, who only has his best interests in mind.  He realizes that his friends were really the ones manipulating him and seeking power, and the prince resolves to do only good from now on.  When the animal keeper has a near-fatal accident, the prince monster breaks out of his cage to save him.  The Fairy of Truth appears momentarily, saying that good actions will be rewarded, and transforms him from the horrible monster into a dog.\nThe animal keeper takes the dog to King Suleiman to report that a miracle has happened. Suleiman's daughter takes a liking to the dog and decides to keep him herself.  One morning the dog receives a spare breakfast of one dinner roll, which he takes out in the countryside.  As he roams, he discovers a house of splendour, made of jewels.  There are well-dressed people going into the building, but when they come out, they are thin and pale, wearing rags and apparently starving to death.  One young girl crawling out of the palace passes the dog, and attempts to eat a blade of grass.  The dog decides to give his roll to the girl.  The girl tells the dog not to go in the house, because it is the Palace of Pleasure, and all the food is poisoned.  The dog sees the shepherdess entering the palace and is desperate to save her.  At this time, the Fairy of Truth appears and rewards his generosity by turning him into a dove.  The dove prince flies around the palace, and through a window he sees the shepherdess, who suddenly vanishes in a puff of smoke.  Resolving to find her, the dove flies all across the land.  Eventually he spies her in a remote place, walking with an old beggar woman in rags.  He flies down and lights on the shepherdess' finger, cooing.  She remarks that it is the most beautiful dove in the world and that if it were a man, she would marry it.   The beggar woman throws off her rags and reveals that she is the Fairy of Truth.  She transforms the dove back into Prince Darling.  The Prince kneels and begs the shepherdess for forgiveness.   The fairy declares that the girl had always loved the prince, but didn't like his bad behaviour.  Prince Darling and the shepherdess are then married, and Prince Darling resumes the throne to become a just and beloved ruler.\n\n\n"

    "plot": "Prince Hyacinth is born to a widowed Queen. He is a beautiful baby, except for his nose- the very largest ever seen. Unknown to either the Queen or any of her court, this giant nose had been foretold before his parents' marriage.\nPrince Hyacinth's father, the King, had sought the help of the Fairy to win the Princess when his courtship failed. Taking pity on the distraught suitor, she told him the secret of breaking the spell that prevented the Princess from marrying: step on the tail of the Princess' great cat. As soon as the King managed to get his foot squarely on the cat's tail, the animal transformed into an angry wizard, who tried to dampen the King's joy. \"You will have a son who will be horribly unhappy\", the enchanter taunted, \"a Prince made miserable because he will not know of the enormity of his own nose\". The King was more confounded than worried by this prediction. After all, how could anyone not know the appearance of his own nose?\nSure enough, the prince grew to be a man with no idea that he had an unusual facial feature. From the moment of his birth, his mother and everyone at court went to great lengths to imply that the length of his nose was not only normal but desirable. Only children with extra-long noses were allowed to play with him, courtiers pulled on their own noses to make them appear longer, his history tutor took pains to describe any handsome or beautiful personage as having had a particularly long nose.\nWhen he became of age, Prince Hyacinth was shown a portrait of a dear little Princess. Falling in love with her instantly, he still had to admit that her nose was extremely small and tilted. His mother, pleased with the match, re-assured him that small noses are actually not considered so ugly in women. Ambassadors were sent to ask the neighboring King for the Dear Little Princess' hand in marriage.\n\nConsent was given, and the joyful Prince travelled to meet her. As he approached, ready to kiss her hand, the Sorcerer appeared and whisked her away.\nThe Prince ordered his entourage of courtiers to leave him and wandered, disconsolate. For the first time in his life, he was alone. He meets the Fairy, a little old woman who takes quite some time adjusting her spectacles to look him over. Her nose is too short to easily secure the glasses, and they repeatedly fall off. Regarding each other, each bursts into laughter. The Prince is stunned to find the Fairy thinks his nose is ridiculous. He sees that everyone flatters her and assumes they have deceived her into believing her tiny nose is not a fault. How foolish some people are, he thinks, not to see the reality of their own character. At dinner, which he is very glad to get, his hunger prompts him to put up with her repeated observations about the length of his nose. Finally, he asks her to stop mentioning his nose. She agrees, promising that she will not only stop talking about it, she will even try to believe he has an ordinary nose, though clearly it could make three reasonable sized ones. With that, the Prince has had enough and rides off. Everywhere he goes, searching for the Dear Little Princess, he meets people who claim that his nose is abnormally large. He thinks them all mad.\nThe old Fairy, who had been so fond of his father, helps Prince Hyacinth. She shuts the Dear Little Princess in a crystal palace and places the palace where the Prince will find it. With great joy, he sets to work to free her, but cannot get through its walls. The Dear Little Princess extends her hand through a window for him to kiss it, but he cannot manage to get his lips past his nose to touch her hand, no matter how he turns or twists. For the first time, he realizes just how long that nose really is, too long!\nWith that realization, the crystal palace shattered into splinters and the old Fairy presented the Dear Little Princess to him with the admonition, \"You see how self-love keeps us from knowing our own defects. We refuse to see them until we find them in the way of our interests.\"\nPrince Hyacinth's nose shrinks down to a usual size and he marries the Dear Little Princess. The two live happily ever after.\n\n\n"

A darkness came over them, and they lost the hind and their way, and separated because they each thought they knew better the way back home. The prince came upon a woman on the seashore, next to a barrel. He saw a golden ring in the barrel, and mentioned it. The woman said he might have it if he took it out; when he bent over, she pushed him in, fastened the top, and threw it into the sea. It drifted a time, but hit against rocks. He guessed he was near land, kicked out the top, and swam ashore. A giant found him there and took him home to his wife. One day, the giant showed him everything of the house but the parlour. When the giant was gone, he tried to look in  As soon as he did, something within moved and tried to speak, frightening him off.  He tried two more times, and the third was brave enough to see a great black dog, and that it said, \"Choose me, Prince Ring.\"\nSometime later, the giant said that he did not have long to live, and so would carry him back to the mainland. He offered the prince anything to take with him; the prince chose what was in the parlour. Surprised, the giant nevertheless gave him the dog and took him to shore in a stone boat, telling him at the end that he could claim the island in two weeks, in which time he and his wife would be dead. The prince and dog walked on. The dog told him he was not curious, since he did not ask his name; the prince asked, and the dog said to call it \"Snati-Snati\". Then they came to a castle, and the dog told him to take service and get a little room for them both.\nThe king quickly esteemed Ring. A counsellor named Red told him that it was odd, when Ring had done so little. The king set both Ring and Red to cutting trees; Ring took two axes, and Snati-Snati cut as well, so that they cut more than twice what Red cut. Growing more jealous, Red said that the king should get Ring to kill and flay the wild oxen in the woods. Finally, the king sent him. There were two, and Snati-Snati took the larger and Ring the smaller, with some help from the dog. The king highly favored him after this.\nRed persuaded him to set Ring to find the gold cloak, chess-board, and piece that the king had lost a year ago. The king added that if he found them before Christmas, he could marry the king's daughter. Snati-Snati told him to get all the salt he could, and then carried it as they set out.  The dog helped him up a cliff, and they came to a hut. Four trolls slept, and the porridge pot was on the fire. Snati-Snati told Ring to pour all the salt into the pot. When the trolls woke, the old hag ate first and complained that she had stolen milk from seven kingdoms and now it was salt. After they ate, the old one became thirsty and sent her daughter to fetch water, but the daughter would not unless the old hag gave her the gold piece. The daughter took it and went, but when she bent to drink, the prince and dog pushed her in. The hag grew thirstier, and sent her son, though he demanded the golden cloak; he met the same fate as his sister. Finally, she sent her husband, though he demanded the golden chessboard; he met the same fate as his children, but when the prince and dog went back to the cottage, his ghost followed them. They had to wrestle with it and defeat it a second time. At the cottage, Snati-Snati said they had to go inside, once the hag got out they could not defeat her, but he would attack with a red-hot iron from the fire and the prince must pour boiling porridge over her, and by those means, they defeated her. They returned to the king late Christmas night. The king was well pleased, but the dog asked Prince Ring to trade places for the night:  he would sleep in the prince's bed, and the prince where he usually slept. Ring agreed, but after a time, the dog sent him to his own bed, with instructions not to meddle with anything about it.\nIn the morning, Red went to the king, with his hand cut off, and demanded justice, but Ring showed him the bed, where the hand still held a sword. The king hanged Red and married Ring to his daughter. Snati-Snati asked to sleep at the foot of the bed, their wedding night; Ring granted this, and in the morning, saw a prince sleeping there, with an ugly dogskin beside him. Ring burned the dogskin and woke the prince. This prince was also named Ring.  His father had married a woman who was a witch and who had cursed him into that shape until a prince of his name let him sleep at his feet his wedding night. This stepmother had been the hind he had hunted, and the woman who had pushed him into the barrel, for fear that the curse would be broken. After the witch was killed, they divided the trolls' treasure, and Ring married the other Ring to his sister, giving him his father's kingdom, while he stayed with his father-in-law and had half the kingdom and the whole after his death.\n\n\n"

Both boys looked about the cottage and set off to seek their fortune so quickly that the second son had to catch up to the first.  When they met, they baptized each other by their chosen names, Shortshanks and King Sturdy, and set out in different directions.  King Sturdy said that Shortshanks could summon him by calling his name three times, but should do so only in the last extremity.\nShortshanks came across, in turn, three old women each of whom had only one eye; he stole each eye, and the women bought them back in return for an enchanted sword, an enchanted ship that could fly over land, and the art of brewing one hundred lasts of malt at once.  He used the ship to sail to the king's castle, where he got a job working for the kitchen-maid.  The castle was hung with black, and he learned that the princess had been promised to three ogres, one of whom was coming to fetch her.  Ritter Red had promised to try to save her, but they do not know that he can do it.\nThe next day, the princess went down to the sea strand.  Ritter Red went with her but, as soon as everyone else was gone, climbed a tree for safety.  Shortshanks asked permission to go down to the sea and, having got it, fought the five-headed ogre that came.  The princess had him sleep a time in her lap, and threw over him a tinsel robe.  Ritter Red threatened to kill the princess if she told who had killed the ogre and cut out its tongue and liver.  Shortshanks took the gold and silver from the ogre's ship and gave it to the kitchen-maid.  He then fought the ten-headed ogre, and the princess threw a silver robe over him while he slept, after.  The third day, he fought the fifteen-headed ogre, and the princess threw over him a golden robe, but before he slept, she told him what Ritter Red had done and would do, and he told her to demand him as the cup-bearer for the wedding; he would spill some of Ritter Red's wine but none of hers, and Ritter Red would strike him three times, but on the third, she was to proclaim that he was the true killer of the ogres.\nEach time Ritter Red struck him, it revealed a new robe, and when the princess proclaimed the truth, Ritter Red produced the lungs and tongues, and Shortshanks the silver and gold, and the king judged that Shortshanks was the true killer and threw Ritter Red in a snake pit.\nThe king told Shortshanks that another ogre had carried off his older daughter.  Shortshanks asked for a long iron cable, five hundred men, and food for them all, and had it put on his ship.  The ship carried them to the middle of the sea.  Shortshanks tied the cable to himself and descended, with orders to be pulled back up if he pulled the cable.  At the bottom, he found the princess, who told him that the ogre was looking for someone who could brew one hundred lasts of malt at once, for his feast.  The princess told the ogre of him, and the ogre set him to brew.  He brewed the ale so strong that all the ogres died of it.  Then he had the five hundred men pull up him, the princess, and the ogre's gold and silver.\nBoth princesses wanted to marry him, but he wanted to marry the first one he saved, the younger.  He summoned his brother King Sturdy, who saw there was no danger, and struck him down.  Shortshanks  told him why he wanted him, and King Sturdy begged his forgiveness.  Shortshanks sent him into the house, saying that whichever princess kissed him would marry him, because the older was stronger and bigger and would reach him first.  So King Sturdy married the older, and Shortshanks the younger, princess.\n\n\n"

One day, when the queen saw her adopted daughter playing with a beggar girl, she scolded her adopted daughter and tried to drive the other girl off.  However, the beggar girl mentioned that her mother knows a way for the queen to become pregnant.\nWhen the queen approached the beggar woman, the woman denies having such knowledge.  The queen treated the woman to as much wine as the woman pleased until the woman is drunk.  When the queen asked the drunk beggar woman how she could get a child of her own, the beggar woman told her to wash herself in two pails of water before going to bed, and afterward pour the water under the bed. The next morning, two flowers will have sprung up from under the bed: one fair and one rare. The beggar tells the queen that she must eat the beautiful one, but not to eat the hideous one no matter what. The queen followed this advice, and the next morning under the bed were two flowers. One was bright and lovely, and the other was black and foul. The queen ate the beautiful flower at once, but it tasted so sweet that she craved the other and ate it as well.\nNot long afterward, the queen bore a child. She gave birth to a girl who carried a wooden spoon in her hand and rode upon a goat. She was very ugly and loud from the moment she was born.  The queen despairs having such a daughter until the girl tells her mother that her next child will be fair and agreeable.  As the girl promised, the queen gave birth to a second daughter, one who was born fair and sweet, which pleased the queen very much. The sisters were as different as they could be, but they were very fond of each other.  The elder daughter was named Tatterhood, because she wore a tattered hood over her unruly hair.\nOne Christmas Eve, when the girls were half grown, there was great noise in the gallery outside the queen's rooms.  When Tatterhood demanded to know what was causing the noise, the queen reluctantly reveals that it was a pack of trolls (in some versions, witches) who come to the palace every seven years.  Tatterhood, being headstrong, decides to drive the trolls off and instructs her mother keep the door tightly shut.  Worried about Tatterhood, Tatterhood's younger sister opens one of the doors during the battle with the trolls.  Her head is instantly snatched off by a troll and replaced with a calf's head, after which the trolls flee from the castle.\nTo restore her sister's head, Tatterhood sets off in a ship with no crew or company aside from her own sister.  They arrive at the isle of the trolls and Tatterhood battles the trolls and successfully regain her sister's head.  The sisters escape and arrive in a distant kingdom.  The king, a widower with one son, fell in love with the younger sister at first sight.  However, she declared she will not marry until Tatterhood does.  The king begged his son to marry Tatterhood, and eventually he reluctantly agreed.\nThe two sisters were to be married to their grooms on the same day. The king, his young princess bride, and the king's son were regally adorned, while Tatterhood refused to dress up and happily wore her rags. As the couples rode to church to be married, Tatterhood asked her bridegroom why he did not ask why she rides a goat, and when he duly asked, she answered that she rode a grand horse, which it promptly becomes. She asked the prince why he does not ask why she carries a wooden spoon, which he asks, and she declares it to be a fan (or in some versions a wand), which it turns into. This is repeated with the tattered hood, which is turned into a golden crown, and with Tatterhood herself, whose beauty she declares to surpass her sister's, which it then does. The prince now understands that she chooses to appear ragged, and that her beauty matters not.  He now is glad to be married to her.\n\n\n"

Her parents could not find her.\nArdan, the eldest son, declared he would set out in search of his sister.  His mother reproved him for not asking his father first. But since he had made a vow, she made two cakes, a large one and a little one, and asked which one he wanted, the big one without her blessing or the little one with it.  He picked the large cake.  When a raven asked him for some, he refused it.  Then he came to an old man in a cottage, with a young woman combing her hair of gold.  The old man offered to let him watch his three cows for a year.  The young woman warned against it, but he refused her advice rudely and took the service anyway.\nThe old man told him to follow the cows, because they knew good pasture, and to never leave them. But the first day watching the cows, he saw a golden cock and a silver hen, and let them distract him, and also a staff of gold and a staff of silver.  When he brought them back, the cows had no milk, only water.  The old man turned Ardan to stone.\nThen Ruais, the second son, set out in the same manner, and suffered the same fate.\nFinally, Covan the Brown-haired, the youngest, asked leave to go after his brothers.  His father gave him his blessing, and Covan took the smaller cake and gave the raven some.  When he came to the cottage, he thanked the maiden for her advice, though he did not take it.  He followed the cows and sat down when they came to pasture.  There he heard music and listened to it.  A boy ran to him and claimed his cows were in the corn; Covan said he could have driven them out in the time it took to come to him.  Then the boy returned with the claim that dogs were worrying the cows; Covan said he could not have driven the dogs out in the time it took to reach him.\nThen the cows went on.  They went through a barren pasture, on which a mare and her foal were fat; a lush pasture with a starving mare and her foal, and a lake with two boats, one with happy youths going to the land of the Sun, and the other with grim shapes, going to the land of Night.  The cows went on, and it grew so dark he could not see the cows.  The Dog of Maol-mor, whom he had heard of, bade him stay the night.  He did.  In the morning, the dog was grateful, because he took what was offered and did not mock him, and so said he could call on him for aid.  The next day, the cows ended in a barren plain.  The raven offered him hospitality and he took it.  The raven was grateful that he took it and did not mock it, and so said he could call on him for aid.  The next day, the cows ended by a river.  The famous otter Doran-donn offered Covan his hospitality, and he took it, and the otter offered to come to his aid.\nThen the cows returned, and they had milk instead of water.  The old man was pleased and wanted to know what Covan wanted as a reward.  Covan wanted to know how to get his brothers and sister back.  The old man warned him that it would be hard, but told him where to get a roe with white feet and a deer's antlers, a duck with a green body and a gold neck, and a salmon with silver skin and red gills.  If he brought those to the old man, he could get his brothers and sister back.  The dog helped him catch the roe; the raven, the duck; and the otter, the salmon.  The old man gave him back his sister, and restored his brothers, though they would be fated to wander forever for their idle and unfaithful ways.\nCovan asked him his name.  He said he was the Spirit of Age.\n\n\n"

A great castle sprang up, and an irate giant demanded to know why he had put it there.  It offered to put it back if the prince gave him his first son, when he reached seven years of age.

The prince tried to hunt the birds.  At noon, the daughter put him to sleep again, and the roofs were thatched with feathers when he woke.  The giant knew he had not done it, and set him to fetch down a bird's nest.  He tried to climb it and got no more than half way.  The daughter built him a ladder of her fingers, and when he got it down, she left her little finger in the tree.\nShe told him that the giant would ask him to pick her out from her sisters, and the only mark would be that she was missing her finger.  The wedding was held and celebrated, and the prince picked out his bride from her sisters.  The giant told them to go to rest.  The daughter told her husband that they had to flee at once, and they took a gray filly.  She left behind slices of apples that answered the giant.  Only when the last one had spoken did he realize that they had fled.  He gave chase.  When the giant nearly caught them, the daughter had the prince take a twig from the filly's ear and throw it behind them:  it became a forest.  The giant got through it, and they threw a pebble that became a mountain.  The giant got through it, and they threw a flask of water that became a wave and drowned him.\nThe daughter forbade him to let anyone or thing in his father's house kiss him, or he would forget her, but a greyhound leaped up to kiss him, and he forgot the daughter.  She stayed in a tree by a well.  A shoemaker's wife and daughter, going to fetch water, both thought her shadow was theirs, and thought themselves too beautiful to fetch water.  The shoemaker went himself, saw her, and persuaded her to come down.\nWhen she stayed his house, some young men tried to woo her, but she made them stick to the latch so they could not approach her.  The shoemaker was making shoes for the king's son, who was to marry, and the daughter persuaded him to take her.  She conjured up a silver and a gold pigeon, and grains.

There, an ogre couple found her, and the ogress resolved to raise Aimee, instead of eating her, resolving that the infant would make a good wife for her son when she grew up.  The ogress summoned a hind from the woods to nurse the baby.  After fifteen years, the king and queen gave up hope of locating the princess and the king told his brother to send his best son to be the heir to the throne.  The brother chose his second son.\nMeanwhile, Aimee grew up among the ogres.  A little ogre had fallen in love with her, but the thought of marrying him revolted her.  She regularly walked along the shore after storms, to protect things swept ashore from the ogres, and one day she found a man.  She saved the man, who happened to be her cousin, although neither of them knew the truth or could speak each other's language.  She managed to make him understand that he had to hide in a cave.  After some time hiding and feeding him, she wished to show her friendship and gave him a locket she wore.  This had her name on it, and the prince deduced from her looks that she was indeed his cousin, the princess Aimee.\nThe little ogre decided it was time for them to marry, and horror-struck, Aimee fled to the prince.  When she returned, she injured her foot on a thorn and could no longer walk.  The prince wondered why she did not come, and when he tried to find her, he was captured.\nNow, every night, the ogres all put on golden crowns before they went to bed.  The princess snuck in that night, took a crown from the head of a little ogre, and put it on the prince's head.  The ogre woke up, seized on the sleeping little ogre who no longer had a crown, and ate him.  Again the next night, the princess stole a crown from one of the ogres to place on the Prince's head.  This time, the ogress ate the crown-less ogre.\nThe princess remembered the magic wand that the ogress had used to summon the hind.  With it, she gave herself the power to speak the prince's language.  He told her who she was, and the princess decided to steal the ogres' camel so they could ride away to safety.  She used the wand to enchant a bean to hide their escape.  It spoke whenever the ogress asked anything.  Finally, however, the ogress realized they had fled.  The ogre used his seven-league boots to follow.\nWhen the ogre caught up, the princess turned herself into a boatwoman, the prince into a boat, and the camel into a lake; to confuse the ogre.  He found nothing, but when he returned, the ogress told him how they had been transformed with her stolen magic wand, and so he set out to find them again.  This time Aimmee turned herself into a dwarf, the prince into a portrait, and the camel into a pillar.  When the ogre reached her, she told an elaborate story about how the prince had fought in a tournament in honor of the lady in the picture.  Confused again, the ogre returned home.\nThis time the ogress came after them.  The princess turned the prince into an orange tree, herself into a bee, and the camel into a box.  The princess stung the ogress and drove her off, but some travelers carried off the wand.  Without the wand, the Princess was unable to change the group back into their prior forms.\nA princess, Linda, loved to walk in the woods where the orange tree stood.

The witch tried to get him to stay the night, but when he refused, demanded a jug of the many-colored waters, or she would turn him into a lizard. She then directed a dog to lead him to the water.\nAt the castle, he heard the owl's cry and asked its advice.  It told him to fill the jug from another fountain and then find the white bird in the corner, not the brightly colored birds. He had a quarter of an hour to do the task, and succeeded.  When he brought back the water, the witch threw it over him and told him to become a parrot, but he became more handsome, and all the creatures about the hut threw themselves into the water and became human again. The witch fled.\nThe courtiers who were responsible for abandoning the children tried to prevent the King from learning about the children, but they talked so much of it that he overheard the commotion and became curious. When the bird flew to him, he listened. The King at once went to embrace his children, and then all three of them freed his wife, their mother, from the tower.

The youngest said that he will go with his brother, and set a geasa that she stand on a tower with her face to the wind, with a sheaf of corn to eat and water to drink, until they returned.\nThe princes met the Black Thief of Sloan, who warned them of the danger but came with them.  When they tried to steal the horse, it rang the bells so that it warned the Knight and they were caught.\nThe knight took them to a furnace, to boil them, from the oldest to the youngest of the princes, and then the Black Thief.  The Black Thief said that he had once been in more danger than the oldest and escaped with his life.  The Knight said that if he told him that story, he would pardon the oldest son.  The Black Thief told that he had once seen three witches going to sleep with their gold under the heads to keep the Black Thief from stealing it; he had put turf under their heads instead and gone off with the gold.  They chased him as a greyhound, a hare, and a hawk.  He climbed a tree.  They changed themselves into a smith's anvil and a piece of iron, which the third one made a hatchet of, and she started to cut down the tree.  But just then, a cock crowed and they disappeared.\nThe knight pardoned the oldest son and set about to boil the second.\nThe Black Thief said he might yet escape, and the knight said that if he had been in another such great danger, he would pardon the second.  The Black Thief told he had heard how a rich bishop had been buried with jewels and rich robes, and he went to rob the grave.  He heard footsteps and lost courage.  Then he met with a dark figure, which he shot at, and found it was one of the clergy, who had already rifled the tomb.  Some guards came.  He held up the body, and the guards shot at it, and ran into the tomb to ensure he had no others with him.  The Black Thief escaped once they were past him.\nThe knight pardoned the second son and said he would pardon the youngest for yet another such tale.\nThe Black Thief told how he had once come to a castle where a woman held a child and wept.  She told him that a giant lived there and had ordered her to kill the child and cook it in a pie.  He killed her a pig and had her cut off a finger; then she baked the pie.  When the giant returned, the woman had him hid in a room where the giant kept corpses.  The giant doubted the pie, but the woman showed him the finger.  Being not full, he went to cut off some meat from the corpses, and cut off some from the thief.  He did not cry out, and the giant got drunk and slept.  He blinded it but could not kill it.  The giant threw a ring after him, and it leapt on his toe, where it called out whenever the giant did.  The thief cut off the toe and threw it into a fishpond, where it called to the giant, who followed and drowned.\nAn old woman told the knight that he was the baby and she the woman, and the thief the man who had saved his life.  They told the knight why they had to get the horse, and to spare their lives, he gave him it.  The queen heard them coming, and threw herself from the tower and died.\n\n\n"

    "plot": "Mizore is a quiet, introverted student in her third and final year of high school, who is an oboist in the school's concert band. Her only friend, who occupies most of her thoughts, is Nozomi, one of the band's flutists, who is much more outgoing and popular. Together, the two rehearse a duet from the musical piece Liz and the Blue Bird, which is based on an eponymous, fictional German fairy tale that Nozomi loved as a child. The story is about a young woman named Liz (represented by the oboe in the musical piece) and an unnamed blue bird turned human (represented by the flute) who become best friends and live together, until the two are forced to part ways. Nozomi and Mizore realize that the story applies closely to their own relationship, which worries Mizore; she sees herself as Liz and Nozomi as the fleeting blue bird.\nAlthough Nozomi spends time with other friends from the band, Mizore keeps herself isolated from everyone except Nozomi, and refuses her other bandmates' offers to spend time together. She also tries to express her love to Nozomi, but is never able to. Niiyama, a woodwind instructor, advises Mizore to apply for music school after graduation so she could become professional; she is not particularly interested at first, but changes her mind after Nozomi says that she might apply as well. However, their bandmates are worried, realizing that Mizore's only motivation for going to music school is to be together with Nozomi.\nAs the concert approaches, Mizore and Nozomi grow apart. Mizore feels insecure about Nozomi because of their history together: during middle school, Nozomi proposed and convinced Mizore to join the band, only to later leave it during their first year of high school due to a schism (as depicted in Sound! Euphonium). As a result, Mizore is afraid that Nozomi could leave her at any moment. Meanwhile, Nozomi shows discomfort at Mizore progressively opening herself to others and being tutored by Niiyama, envious of her greater potential. Furthermore, the two have trouble perfecting their duet, both because of their increasingly complicated relationship and because of their difficulty connecting with the characters from Liz and the Blue Bird; Mizore, in particular, does not understand why Liz would ever let the blue bird go free instead of keeping it with her forever.\nEventually, the two come to a greater understanding of their relationship, thanks to the assistance of Niiyama and other members of the band. They ultimately come to realize that, while they associated Mizore to Liz and Nozomi to the blue bird, Mizore was actually closer to the blue bird\u2014having to let go of her unconditional attachment so she can live her own life\u2014while Nozomi was closer to Liz, who let the bird go free so that she would not weigh it down. At the next rehearsal, they perform the piece perfectly. Mizore's performance moves her bandmates and leaves Nozomi in tears. They confront each other afterwards, Nozomi having realized that Mizore was underperforming so the two would be on the same level. Nozomi also reveals that she did not really want to go to music school, and had only said so out of jealousy, even though she knew she did not have the skill necessary to be accepted. Mizore, upset that Nozomi seems to be abandoning her once again, confesses the extent of her feelings, calling the other her \"everything\". However, Nozomi only laughs, knowing that accepting Mizore's feelings would only continue to confine her.\nSome time later, Mizore and Nozomi are seemingly still distant from each other, with Nozomi prioritizing her studies over the band. After they meet in the school's library, Nozomi offers to eat together outside. On the way, she claims that she will back up Mizore perfectly in their duet, only asking for \"a little time\" and implying that she intends to overcome her jealousy and support Mizore in her life and decisions, while Mizore answers that she will keep on playing the oboe, hinting at her acceptance to finally follow her own path instead of Nozomi's.\n\n\n"

Advised that the remedy is a head gardener \"whose forefathers were also gardeners\", he finds such a man. Under this gardener's care the land does flourish, but a new problem arises.\nThe princess loves the gardener's son \u2013 and will marry no one else. After she refuses her father's choice of a husband (the prime minister's son), he contrives a contest to settle the matter: the two men must go to a far destination and the first to return shall marry the princess. They do not go off on an equal footing. The Minister's son is equipped with a fine horse and gold, while the gardener's son is given a lame horse and copper. Traveling swiftly, the minister's son encounters a woman in rags. Weak and starving, she begs for his help. He spurns her.\nThe gardener's son then encounters the woman. Generously, he gives her his purse and invites her to ride behind him. At the next city, heralds announce that the sultan is sick, and that whoever cures him can name the reward. The woman, who is a witch, instructs the boy: find and slay three particular dogs, burn them and collect their ashes, then make way to the sultan. Place the dying sultan in a cauldron over a roaring fire, and boil him right down to his bones. Finally, arrange the bones properly and scatter the dogs' ashes over them. The gardener's son does all these things and the sultan revives, in full hearty youth. Exactly as the witch suggested, the gardener's son chooses the bronze ring for his reward and will accept nothing else. This ring contains a djinni who grants any wish. Now the gardener's son continues his journey in a fabulous sailing ship, with a cargo of gems, sails of brocade and a hull of gold, crewed by a dozen handsome sailors, each dressed as richly as a king \u2013 all gifts of the bronze ring.\nEventually he meets his rival, who has spent all his fortune. Unrecognized, the gardener's son offers to supply his rival with a ship - on the condition that the skin of his back be branded with the imprint of the bronze ring, heated in a fire. Once that is done, the gardener's son asks the ring to prepare a ship with half-rotten timbers painted black, ragged sails and a maimed and sickly crew. In this ship the prime minister's son returns, and claims his bride from the king.\nAs the unhappy princess' wedding is being prepared, the king looks out on the harbor and wonders at the gleaming gold ship sailing into it. He is so taken by the sight of its captain (the gardener's son) that he invites him to the wedding and, after closer inspection, actually invites him to give away the bride. The gardener's son agrees, but when he sees the intended groom he objects, telling the king that the man is not worthy of the princess, being nothing more than his own slave. The prime minister's son denies this, but the brand of the bronze ring on his back serves as proof of the claim. The gardener's son marries the delighted princess that day with the king's blessing. They have a short period of happiness.\nMeanwhile, a student of the black arts has come to learn about the djinni of the bronze ring. When the prince sails off for a trip in his golden ship, he persuades the princess to trade him the ring for some red fish. Once he has the ring, he wishes the prince's boat from gold into rotten wood, his crew from princely appearing men into hideous slaves, and the cargo of gems into ravenous black cats. (In the original French source, the magician is a Jew and the debased crew become Negroes. Modern editions of the Blue Fairy Book tend to omit these details.)Realizing that an enemy must now have his bronze ring, the prince sails on until he comes to an island inhabited by mice. The Mouse Queen sends an envoy to ask that the ship sail away with its terrible cargo of cats. The prince agrees, on the condition that his bronze ring be found and returned to him. The Mouse Queen contacts all the mice of the world, three of whom know that the magician keeps the bronze ring in his pocket when awake, and in his mouth when asleep. The three go to retrieve the ring. One of them tickles the sleeping magician's nose with her tail, and he expels the ring from his mouth with a sneeze. After some misadventures, the mice manage to return the ring to the prince, who restores his golden vessel and hurries home to the princess. He captures the magician and has the man broken into pieces by being tied to the tail of a savage mule.\n\n\n"

There, the housewife told him that her husband was to marry the daughter of the King of the Skies, let her stay the night, gave her shears that would cut on their own, and sent her on to her middle sister.  The middle sister gave her a needle that would sew on its own and sent her on to the youngest sister.  The youngest sister gave her thread that would thread the needle itself, and keep up with the needle and shears and sent her on to a town.\nShe found a place to stay with a henwife and asked for something to sew, although the king's daughter was marrying the next day and no one was working.  The shears, needle, and thread set to work.  A royal serving-maid saw and told the king's daughter, who asked what was wanted for them.  The woman asked for leave to sleep where the king's daughter had slept that night.  The king's daughter agreed, but gave her bridegroom a sleeping draught and threw the woman out in the morning.  The next night, she again exchanged for the needle, and the sleeping drink worked as before, but his oldest son slept beside his father, and heard her tell the sleeping man that she was the mother of his children.  The next day, the woman exchanged for the thread, but the man threw out the sleeping drink, and they spoke.  When the king's daughter came down to throw the woman out, he said she could go back up, this was his wife.\n\n\n"

The Prince promises to return for the maiden, who sits to work her neglected wheel. Sure enough, the bright thread is dull now, just as the woman had predicted. Terrified, she is convinced that misfortunes will now come. Soon enough, the woman comes and with one glance at the tarnished thread knows everything. The youngest maiden manages to send a message to her Prince through a raven. The Prince comes to her and carries her off.\nThe woman is enraged and, as she is a wicked witch, promptly casts a spell. She conjures a magic ball, which flies by the maiden as she is held by the mounted Prince crossing a bridge.  Whirlwinds cast her from the Prince's arms and into the river. Though he tries to dive in after her, he is restrained by his men. A year later, visiting the spot, he sees a yellow water lily in the river and hears a voice sing a forlorn song about being bewitched and forsaken. He goes on through the forest to the hut and consults the gold-spinners, who insist that the flower must be their sister. He sleeps the night in the hut, having a magic cake for his dinner secretly prepared by the eldest sister. In the morning, as he rides off, he understands the language of the birds. In this way he learns that the Wizard of Finland can help him, and through the birds,  contacts him. The wizard, in the form of an eagle, instructs him to stand on the river bank, smeared with mud, and say \"From a man into a crab\". Once he becomes a crab, he is to swim to the flower, cut its roots, and rise with the lily to the surface. Drifting with the current, he is to ascend a large stone, say \"From a crab into a man, from a water-lily into a maiden\" and so save the maiden.\nHe does all of these things and the maiden is restored, more beautiful than ever and dressed in magnificent robes and jewels. Now, although to the Prince only hours had passed in fulfilling his mission, actually 10 days had gone by and the King and Queen were at church, weeping for their dead son. The Prince and maiden arrive and are married on the spot. In their happiness, the Prince forgets his promise to the Wizard, to free the two maidens. A crow berates them, how could they forget the sisters. Chagrined, the Prince rescues the pair. The eldest makes up a poisoned cake, which the witch eats on her return and dies. The Prince and his bride and her sisters live quite happily, recovering 50 wagonloads of the gold thread that had been hidden away by the witch.\n\n\n"

    "plot": "A dying king asked of his queen that she would never remarry, but rather devote the rest of her life to caring for their only son.  She promised to do as he requested, but no sooner was her husband dead than she remarried and had her new husband made king instead of her son.  The stepfather was a wicked man and treated his stepson very cruelly.\nBy the castle, there was a brook that was of milk rather than water, which had plenty for everyone, but the new king forbade anyone to take the milk.  The guards noticed a gold-bearded man taking buckets of milk in the morning and then strangely vanishing.  The king came to see.  He wondered if he could ever capture such a man, and many attempts failed.  One day, an old soldier told him to leave bread, bacon, and drugged wine for the man; he would eat, drink, and fall asleep.  Then they could catch him.  The plan succeeded, and the king put the man in a cage.  After a month had passed, the king had to go to war.  He told his stepson to feed the man but not free him, or his fate would be terrible.\nThe prince accidentally shot an arrow into the cage, and the gold-bearded man refused to give it back unless he freed him.  After much pleading, the prince was convinced.  The gold-bearded man promised to repay him a thousand-fold and vanished.  The prince decided that running away could not be more dangerous than staying and left.  As he went along, he met a wood dove.  He was on the verge of shooting it when it implored him not to because its two children would starve.  He spared it, and the dove said that because of his act of mercy it would find a way to repay him.  The prince continued on, eventually meeting with a duck and then later a stork. Both times the same thing happened as had with the wood dove.\nHe met with two soldiers, and they traveled together in search of work.  A king hired the soldiers as coachmen and the prince as his companion.  The jealous soldiers told him the prince had claimed that if he were made the king's steward, he could ensure that no grain was lost from the king's store; if he set the prince to separate wheat and barley, it would show what his boasting was worth.  The king had two enormous sacks mixed and ordered the prince to separate them.  The wood dove, who was the king of the wood doves, had his fellow doves sort them.  The king appointed him steward.\nThis made the soldiers more jealous.  They then told the king that the prince had claimed that were he in charge of the royal treasures, he would ensure that none were lost; if the king had a ring from the princess's finger thrown in the stream, it would show what his boasting was worth.  The king did so, and the duck, who was the king of the ducks, had his ducks find it.  The king appointed him in charge of his treasures.\nThe soldiers now claimed that the prince had said he knew of a child who could speak every language and play every musical instrument.  The king thought this was magic, which he had tried to learn, and ordered the prince to produce the child, as a third task or be dragged to death.  The stork brought the child to him.  The king married him to his daughter, and asked how he had done it.  The prince told him, and the king had the soldiers driven away with whips.\n\n\n"

A traveller said that if a golden-headed fish, found in the Great Sea, was brought to him within a hundred days, he would prepare an ointment from its blood to save the king's sight, but he had to leave in a hundred days.  The prince took men and fished for it.  He finally caught it, too late to bring it back.  He intended to bring it back to show his father what he had done, and decided not to, because the doctors would try to make the ointment and so kill the fish uselessly.\nThe king refused to believe he had tried, and ordered his execution.  Servants warned the queen who gave her son common clothing and gold and sent him off to a distant island with a warning to take no man in his service who wanted to be paid every month.  At the island, he bought a house and rejected many servants, who wanted to be paid by the month, and finally took on an Arab who wished to be paid every year.\nOn this island, a monster left half of it a wasteland, and whoever went to fight it fell asleep.  The Arab asked the governor what he would give for killing it, and the governor offered half the land and his daughter; the Arab asked instead that he share in whatever he gained.  The governor agreed.  The Arab killed the monster and told the prince to take the credit.  The governor gave him a ship at his request, and secretly filled it with jewels.\nThey sailed to a far country.  The Arab urged the prince to ask the king for his daughter.

    "plot": "\nA king is travelling to through the forest, but quickly gets lost. While wandering, he meets an old man who offers to help guide him home in exchange for the first thing that comes out of the king's palace upon his arrival. Recalling that his faithful and beloved dog always greeted him first on his return, the king is displeased with the proposed deal. However, having no other obvious choices, he accepts the deal. Unexpectedly, when he reaches his palace, the first thing that comes out is his infant son in the arms of a nurse. Upon seeing this, the king plans a deception to save his son. He exchanges his son with a peasant's daughter and raises her as a princess. One year later, when the old man arrives to claim his end of the bargain, the king hands over the girl. Overjoyed that his deception worked, the king orders for a lavish celebration. In order to ensure that the old man doesn't learn about the deception, the king lets his son grow up in the peasant's house.\nHis foster parents get rewarded for their care of the king's son, and they are content. The prince, however learns about the deception and the fate of the girl for whom he had been exchanged. He became distraught at the knowledge that he would someday become king while she would suffer with the stranger. He develops an ingenious plan to save her.\nOne day, the young man leaves his home dressed in a sack and carrying a bag of peas. He then enters the same forest where his father was lost many years ago. For several hours he walks in circles, as if he was lost. Suddenly, a strange old man appears before him and begins to question where he is going. The prince replies that he is carrying the peas from his aunt's funeral and is going to deliver them to the watchers, a custom followed in the kingdom. The old man offers to give the wanderer a job and the prince agrees. Happy that the young man accepted his offer, he twirls and sings as he escorts the prince to his secret home. Because of this, the old man does not notice that the prince is dropping peas along the way.\nThe stranger leads the prince into a dark, deep cave. As they pass further into the depths, a pale light begins to glow above their heads. At last, the prince is able to make out a silent countryside filled with animals, where absolute stillness reigns. Suddenly, the prince hears a sound like a troupe of horses, but the old man says it was a kettle boiling. The prince then hears a noise that resembles the whirring of a saw-mill, which the man dismisses as his grandmother's snoring. The two continue through the strange country and reach a lonely house on a hill. Here the old man had the prince hide in a kennel because his grandmother could not stand new faces.  The prince did not enjoy it, but complied. After a few hours, he is finally beckoned in by the old man. At once, his anger at being placed in a kennel turns to joy as he catches sight of a beautiful brown-eyed maiden.\nThe girl carefully brings out food and sets it on a table in the room, seemingly unaware of the young stranger. The old man sits down and eats ravenously, telling the girl to give only scraps to the prince.  He tells the prince he may rest two days in the house, but on the third he will put him to work. When the prince opens his mouth to reply, the old man forbids him to speak.  The maiden shows him a room. Enchanted by her demureness and beauty, the prince guesses she is not the man's daughter, but the peasant girl exchanged for him. He retires to his room and plots his next move.\nOn the second day, he draws water and hews wood for her. He wanders around the farmstead and sees many animals, including a black cow, a white-faced calf and, alone in a stable, a white horse. On the third day, the stranger sends the prince to clean the horse's stall and to scythe enough grass for the horse to eat. The prince is satisfied with this easy task. The maiden, who knows the enormous appetite of the horse, whispers a suggestion that he weave a strong rope from the grass. He should then warn the horse that he will bind its mouth shut and plug it up (prevent it from defecating) if the animal eats too much. The young man does as she suggests, and the horse, hearing his words, stops eating and does not foul its stall.\nNext, the old man sends the prince to milk a cow of all its milk. Again, the maiden secretly helps the newcomer by telling him to heat a pair of tongs and threaten to use them if the cow does not give all her milk. The prince obeys, and the cow provides all its milk.\nThen the old man sends the prince to bring in all the hay from a haystack.  The maiden knows that this task cannot be accomplished even in a week. She tells the prince to tie the horse to the haystack and count.  He does so, and when the horse asks why he is counting, the prince is to say he is counting packs of wolves in the forest. He does so and the terrified horse begins to run, quickly, hauling back the entire stack of hay.\nThe old man is angry at the prince's success, so he sends him on an even more difficult task. He tells him to bring the white-faced calf to the pasture. The calf is flighty and frightened, but the maiden advises the prince to tie himself to the calf with a silk thread to ensure it will not escape from him. The prince does so and returns with the calf.\nExhausted and furious, the old man tells the prince that there is no more work to do. He tells the prince to sleep, and he tells him that he must offer him his hand when he wakes. The maiden tells the prince that the old man means to eat him, so the next morning the prince should offer the old man a red-hot shovel instead of his hand. The prince obeys her again, but the old man is cunning. He refuses to shake the shovel for he knows it is not the prince's hand.\nThe next morning, the old man tells the young prince that he is satisfied with his work and, to show his gratitude, he will marry him to his daughter. The prince is overjoyed and runs to find his princess. When he tells her of the old man's announcement, she is shocked that the old man has discovered her secret - that she is the one who has given the prince the secrets to succeed in his tasks. The girl directs the prince to cut off the head of white-faced calf and withdraw from it a red ball, shining and pulsing with light, and to bring the ball to her.  The prince does as she asks, and the two flee the house with the glowing ball to guide them. The prince finds that the peas he left behind him have sprouted and grown, creating a clear route back to the palace.\nIn the morning, the old man wakes to find his house empty. He first thinks the young people were not eager to marry. After searching for them, he realizes that they have fled. He has three stalls of goblins in his barn, and he summons all the creatures from the first stall and sends them after the prince and the girl.  As he does so, the magic ball pulses in the girl's hands. She has it change her into a brook and the prince into a fish. The goblins later return to the old man and say they had found nothing but a brook with a fish in it.\nThe old man goes to the second stall in the barn and sends the goblins after the couple, instructing them to drink the brook and catch the fish. Before they can find the couple, however, the maiden turns herself into a rose bush and the prince into a rose. The goblins return to the old man and say there was nothing but a rose bush with one lone rose.\nThe old man goes to his third and largest stall to summon his mightiest goblins. The goblins are unleashed and run out to tear up the rose tree. Before they reached the couple, however, the maiden turns herself into a breeze and the prince into a fly. After the goblins depart, the girl laments that the old man will be able to identify her and the young man regardless of the forms they take.  She says they must each go to their own home, but the prince says they must stay together and marry. He pleads with her to change her mind, but she answers by rolling the ball into the peasant's cottage and then vanishing inside.\nThe prince returns to his castle, where he finds that his father, the king, has died. On his deathbed, the late monarch confessed to switching the maid and the prince to deceive the stranger.  The prince mourns his beloved father and publicly reveals to his new subjects all that had transpired. His people agree that the new king should marry the girl and make her his queen.\n\n\n"

    "name": "The Horse Gullfaxi and the Sword Gunnfoder",
    "plot": "There was once a king whose queen bore her one son named Sigurd (Icelandic: Sigur\u00f0ur), but she died when the prince was ten years of age.  The king grieved his loss for a long time, until one day at the queen's grave (or haugr, a burial mound) he struck friendship with a woman named Ingiborg (Ingibj\u00f6rg), and some days later the king married her. Sigurd became very fond of his stepmother.\nOne evening Ingiborg spoke to Sigurd and advised him to accompany the king on his hunt the following day.  When Sigurd refused, Ingiborg predicted nothing good would come out of his refusal, and hid Sigurd under the bed during the king's absence.  In a while, a giantess (or Icelandic: tr\u00f6llkona \"troll-woman\" in the original) came to visit, addressing Ingiborg as her sister, pressing to know if Sigurd was home. Ingiborg entertained the giantess but persevered in deny Sigurd's presence. The process is repeated the following day, with another giantess asking for Sigurd, without success.  The giantess who arrived the third time too would leave empty-handed, so it seemed, but she cleverly managed to lay a spell, which she said would work on Sigurd if he were within earshot. The spell left him horribly disfigured, half scorched and half withered, with an irrepressible longing to seek out the giantess to gain peace of mind.\n\nDefeating the three giantessesIngiborg took Sigurd from his hideout under the bed, and chastised his stubbornness, but prescribed a way to remedy the situation.\nShe gave him a ball (or \"clew\" hno\u00f0a) of string, and three gold rings.  If he let the ball of string roll, it would lead him to a giantess, and though she would threaten to make a meal of him in the pot and seize him with a boat-hook, he should bribe her with the gift of one of the rings. She would then offer to wrestle with him until his strength ran out and offer him a horn to drink out of, which he should accept since a draft of this will make him strong enough to overcome her.  He was to repeat the process with her two other giantess sisters. But should Ingiborg's dog appear before him with tears running down its snout, that was the sign that her life was in imminent danger, and he should return to help his stepmother.He followed her directions, finding all three giantesses in turn, the next giantess increasingly larger and more hideous.  Sigurd had to offer a larger ring as bribe at each turn, but he also grew more powerful with the drinking-horn offered by each of the giantesses.\n\nBefriending Helga, the giant's daughterThe last giantess, after her defeat at the end of their bout, now steered Sigurd towards a fresh adventure, declared him \"stronger than ever you were\" (that is to say, no longer withered and restored to full health \"or\u00f0inn fr\u00edskur aftur\"), and wishing him luck. He was to go to a nearby lake, find a little girl (called Helga) playing with a boat, and befriend her with the gift of a little gold ring that the last giantess provided. Sigurd became the girl's playmate during the day, and when evening fell, persuaded Helga to take him to her home, past her initial objection, on account of her father being a \"fierce giant\".But as soon as they approached the door, Helga brandished her glove (gl\u00f3fi) over him, transforming him into a bundle of wool (or a \"hank, or coil\" of wool, ullar-h\u00f6nk), which she tossed on her bed. Her father returned, searching every corner, and declared \"'This place smells of men. What's that you threw on the bed, Helga?\" (He begins his line with the Icelandic equivalent of \"Fee-fi-fo-fum..\" in the original text.) But Helga was able to explain it was just the wool that he smelled. The next day, Helga returned to the lake with the wool bundle and restored Sigurd back to shape with her glove, and they played at the lake during the day. On the third day, her father was going out into town, which meant they had the house to themselves the whole day, and since she was given custody of all the keys, they played games opening every room. But Sigurd noticed there was one key she did not use, and asked her about it. She blushed and did not answer. He tried to sway her to show him the unopened room, when he caught glimpse of an iron door, and sweet-talked her into opening it, which she agreed to do so only partially.\nWonderful horse and sword\nInside was a horse named Gullfaxi \"Golden Mane\" and a sword named Gunnfoder (Icelandic: Gunnfj\u00f6dur) \"Battle-Plume\". The sword was richly ornamented, and had an inscription on its hilt that read \"He who rides this horse and wears this sword will find happiness\"(Icelandic: Hver sem \u00e1 \u00feessum hesti situr og me\u00f0 \u00feessu sver\u00f0i gyr\u00f0ir sig mun g\u00e6fuma\u00f0ur ver\u00f0a).  Sigurd wanted to take a ride on the horse with all its trappings for one circuit, and Helga refused at first but eventually relented and revealed the name of the horse and sword. Much of the exchanged dialogue inserted here by Lang are his embellishments (e.g., \"'My father is a king, but he has not got any sword so beautiful as that. Why, the jewels in the scabbard are more splendid than the big ruby in his crown! Has it got a name? Some swords have, you know.\") Helga gave him \"the stick and the stone and the twig\" that belonged as a set with the rest. Whoever is on the horse's back can throw the twig and have a great forest appear to hinder his pursuer. If the enemy is not foiled, then he can strike (or prick) the stone with the stick and a hailstrom will kill the foe.Helga finally relented under the condition Sigurd would only ride once around, but at the end of the circuit, Sigurd rode away.  Helga's father returned to discover the theft and ran after Sigurd riding away on Gullfaxi.  (Lang's tale calls the father a giant, but the original merely refers to him as a man or \"carl\".). Sigurd cast the twig to make a thickly wooded forest emerge, hoping to block his pursuer, but the giant retrieved an axe to cut it down, and was hot on his tail. So Sigurd hit (or poked) the stone causing the hailstorm killing the giant. Had Sigurd hit the stone without turning it over on the other side, he himself would have been struck and killed by the hail.\nAs Sigurd was riding towards his home, his stepmother's dog came running for him, and he hastened back to find nine man-servants (or \u00fer\u00e6lar \"thralls\") ready to burn Ingiborg at the stake.  He struck out in anger and kills all of them with his sword (in the Icelandic original, the name Gunnfj\u00f6\u00f0ur is explicitly given here). Then he set his ailing father in ease, who had mistakenly held Ingiborg responsible for the murder of his son. Sigurd brought Helga home, and they had a great marriage feast.,\n\n\n"

At his lair on an abandoned oil rig (which he shares with the scientist's other creations: six childish clones, a dwarf named Martha, and a brain in a vat named Irvin), he uses a dream-extracting machine to steal dreams from children. The children are kidnapped for him from a nearby port city by a cyborg cult called the Cyclops, who in exchange he supplies with mechanical eyes and ears. Among the kidnapped is Denree (Joseph Lucien), the adopted little brother of carnival strongman One (Ron Perlman).\nAfter the carnival manager is stabbed by a mugger, One is hired by a criminal gang of orphans (run by a pair of Siamese twins called \"the Octopus\") to help them steal a safe. The theft is successful, but the safe is lost in the harbor when One is distracted by seeing Denree's kidnappers. He, together with one of the orphans, a little girl called Miette (Judith Vittet), follows the Cyclops and infiltrates their headquarters, but they are captured and sentenced to execution. Meanwhile, the Octopus orders circus performer Marcello (Jean-Claude Dreyfus) to return One to them. He uses his trained fleas, which inject a poison capsule that causes mindless aggression, to turn the Cyclops guards against each other. While Marcello is rescuing One, Miette falls into the harbor and sinks, seemingly drowned, but an amnesiac diver living beneath the harbor rescues her.\nMiette leaves the diver's lair to find One and Marcello both drowning their sorrows in a bar. Upon seeing Miette alive the remorseful Marcello lets One leave with her. However the Octopus confronts them on the pier, and uses Marcello's stolen fleas to turn One against Miette. A spectacular chain of events triggered by one of Miette's tears leads to a ship crashing into the pier before One can throttle her. Marcello arrives and sets the fleas on the Octopus, allowing One and Miette to escape to continue searching for Denree.\nBack at Krank's oil rig, Irvin tricks one of the clones into releasing a plea for help in the form of a bottled dream telling the story of what is going on on the oil rig. It reaches One, Miette, and the diver, and the latter remembers that he was the scientist who made them, and that the oil rig was his laboratory before Krank and Martha attacked him and pushed him off it to take it for themselves, leaving him for dead in the water. They all converge on the rig; the diver to destroy it and the duo to rescue Denree.\nMiette is almost killed by Martha, but the diver harpoons her.

The giant gets up and tries some, and realizes what the Master Maid has done.\n\nSeeing them sailing, he sets a monster to drink up the sea, but the Master Maid has the prince throw down the salt, and it transforms into a mountain, cutting off the water.  The giant sends for a monster to bore through the hill, but when he reaches the other side, the Master Maid has the prince refill the ocean by pouring the flask of water into it.  The monster drinks it up again, but before the giant can catch the couple, they reach the prince's father's lands.\nThe prince is unwilling that she should walk into his father's castle and proposes that he should fetch a coach and seven to carry her.  She says that he will forget her, and he says that he will never.  She makes him promise to go straight home and only fetch the horses, neither speaking to anyone nor eating anything.\nHe finds a wedding party for one of his brothers, and sets about getting the coach.  The wedding guests, finding he will not come in, go out with food, and when he is about to ride off, the bride's sister rolls an apple to him, and he bites it and forgets the Master Maid.\nThe Master Maid finds a dirty old hut, where an old woman lives, to stay.  She says she will clean it up and puts gold in the pot on the fires.  The gold bubbles up and gilds the cottage.  The old woman is so frightened she flees, and the Master Maid lives there.\nA constable finds her and wants her to marry him.  She sends him off for a sackful of gold, and then she says she must bank the fire.  The constable says he will do it, and once he has the poker, she says that he will hold it, and it will hold him, and he will shovel red-hot coals over himself all night.  And so he does. As soon as day broke, and he finally was able to rid himself of the poker, he set off as though the bailiff or the devil were after him.\nA clerk finds her the same manner.  When he has brought the money, she says she must shut the door.  The clerk says he will, and once he has the door latch, the Master Maid says that he will hold it, and it will hold him, and he will go back and forth all night.  And so he does.\nA sheriff finds her in the same manner.  When he has brought the money, she says she must bring in a calf.  The sheriff says he will, and once he has it by the tail, the Master Maid says that he will hold it, and it will hold him, and he will tour the world all night.  And so he does.\nThe next morning, her prince was to marry, to the bride's sister who had rolled the apple to him, but as the coach was setting out, a harness pin broke, and so did any pin they replaced it with.  The constable says that if they borrowed the poker from the Master Maid, that will hold, and they do so, and it does.\nBut the coach bottom broke, and so did any bottom they replaced it with.  The clerk says that if they borrowed the door from the Master Maid, that will hold, and they do so, and it does.\nBut then the horses would not pull, no matter how hard they were whipped.  The sheriff says that if they borrowed the calf from the Master Maid, it will pull the coach, and they do so, and it does.\nThe prince insists on inviting the Master Maid to the wedding feast.\nThe Master Maid puts the golden apple on the table and then the golden chickens, which start to fight over the apple.   The prince comments on it, and the Master Maid says that it was just as they fought to get away from the giant, and his memory is restored, so he marries the Master Maid instead of the bride's sister. The bride's sister is killed for being a witch.\n\n\n"

He told her if she came to the castle, he would make her the countess's lady-maid.  She refused because she had to look after her grandmother, and was betrothed to a huntsman named Guilbert.  He returned again, offering to make her a lady-in-waiting, and then to dismiss the countess and marry her.  The last offer would not have moved her even if she had wanted to be the countess, because the countess had helped her when her grandmother was ill.\nSome time later, he saw her spinning flax, and asked what she was about.  She told him she was making her wedding shift, as she was to be married, if he gave his leave.  He told her that she must spin nettles instead, to make her shift and his shroud, because she would not marry until he was laid in his grave.  Guilbert offered to kill the count.

    "plot": "An emperor's golden apple tree was robbed every night, and his sons set themselves to watch it. The older two slept, but the youngest stayed awake. Nine peahens arrived. Eight rifled the tree, while the ninth came down beside him and became a beautiful maiden. She talked with him. He begged her to leave one apple, and she left two. This went on for two nights, until his brothers spied on him and saw how it happened. They made a bargain with a witch, and the next night she leapt up and cut off a lock of the maiden's hair. The prince caught the witch and had her executed, but the peahens did not return.\nGrieving, the prince set out in search of his beloved. He found a castle with an aging empress, who had one daughter. On hearing that nine peahens bathed in the lake outside, he set out, despite her efforts to have him stay. The empress bribed his servant to blow a whistle when the nine peahens approached. This threw him into an enchanted sleep. The ninth tried to wake him, but to no avail. She told the servant they would come on the next day and never again. The next day, the servant put him to sleep again, and the maiden told him that if the prince wanted to find her, he should roll the under peg on the upper. The servant repeated this to the prince.  The prince cut off his head and went on alone.\nA hermit directed him to a castle, he found the ninth peahen, and they were married at once. One day his wife, the empress, had to go on journey, and forbade him to go into the twelfth cellar. When he went in, a cask with iron bands about it asked him for water.  He gave it three cups. It burst, and a dragon sprang out to fly off and capture the empress.\nHe set out in search of her.  He saw a fish on the bank, helped it into the water, and received a scale to call it; a fox in a trap, and received a couple of hairs; and a wolf in another trap, and received a couple of hairs. He found where the empress was held captive, and they tried to escape. The dragon saw them and wanted to pursue them, but his horse told him there was plenty of time to eat and drink before setting off and, sure enough, after he had eaten and drunk, the dragon captured them. He let the prince go because of the drinks of water, but promised it would be the only clemency.\nThe prince returned to the castle and had the empress ask the dragon where he got the horse. The dragon related how a witch had a mare and foal, and that whoever watched over these for her for three days would get his pick of her horses, but that whoever failed in the task would lose his life. The prince travelled to the witch's house and noticed that, all around it poles had been set up, all but one of which had a skull upon it. She hired him to look after the horses. He watched all day, but fell asleep during the night - whereupon they escaped into the water. Using the scale he had been given, the prince summoned the fish, who told him the charm with which to get them out. When he went back for dinner, the witch scolded the horse, listened to the excuse it gave for being recaptured by the prince and told it to try going among the foxes on the morrow. The next day the prince used the fox hairs to summon the fox to retrieve the mare and foal, and, the day after that, the wolf hairs to call the wolf to retrieve them from among the wolves.\nWhen, at last, the prince came to claim his reward, he asked for the ugly horse in the corner and would not be dissuaded from his choice, but straightway hastened back to the castle on his new steed and carried off the empress.  When the dragon saw this, he asked his horse whether he had time to eat and drink before setting off in pursuit, but the horse said he would not catch the fugitives, regardless of whether he ate first or set off straight away. Undaunted, the dragon set off anyway and, during the pursuit, the dragon's horse complained to the prince's of the effort involved in trying to catch him. The prince's horse asked the dragon's horse why it put up with it - whereupon the dragon's horse threw the dragon and killed him, and the empress rode it the rest of the way home.\n\n\n"

The hen had gone missing, and the widow she sent her eldest to find it, even if she had to go out in the hill above where they lived. After searching far and wide without success, the girl heard a voice call from a cleft in the rock:\n\nand when she investigated, she stepped on a trap-door and fell underground.  She went through a series of rooms, each room ever increasingly finer-looking as she proceeded, until in the innermost chamber she encountered a hideous-looking \"man of the hill-folk\" or \"Man o' the Hill\" (old spelling: Bjergmand; modern Bokm\u00e5l/Nynorsk: bergmann), also later on referred to as  \"the troll\" (Troldet).The troll asked her to be his sweetheart, and when she declined, he angrily wrung her head off.  The middle daughter was sent out to look for her sister and the hen, but met the same fate. The youngest daughter too fell down the chute, but prudently did some exploring, so that when she opened the hatch-door to the cellar she discovered her dead sisters inside. Since she deduced what befell her sisters, when asked by the troll to be his sweetheart, she pretended to agree wholeheartedly.\nThough she was furnished with fine clothing and anything else she desired, she proclaimed one day that she worried for her mother, who must be hungry and thirsty, with no one else there to attend to her.  The troll would not allow her to go home, but if wanted, she could fill a sack with food, which he would carry to her mother.  The youngest daughter stuffed the sack with gold and silver and put a little food on top to camouflage it.  She forbade him to look inside along the way. After while, his load felt so heavy he was tempted to look, but she shouted after him that she saw what he was doing.\n\nIt so happened that a billy goat fell into the hill, and the troll wrung the head off the \"shaggy beast\".  When the youngest daughter complained that the animal could have kept her company, the troll took a crock (krukke) from the wall, smeared its content on the goat's wound to put the head back on the body, bringing it back to life.\nThe youngest sister awaited opportunity, and when the troll was away from home, used the crock to restore life to her oldest sister. Concealing the revived sister inside the sack, camouflaged with food on top, the youngest told the troll to carry that sack again to her mother, making him promise never to peek inside. When the troll did try to sneak a look, he heard a voice shout \"I see what you're at!\", prompting the baffled troll to answer \"You've got one devil of a pair of eyes\". The voice actually came from the sister he was carrying in the sack, but he mistook it for his sweetheart shouting. The youngest made the troll carry the middle sister the same way, except it was a great deal heavier this time because she stuffed the sack with gold and silver as well.\n\nThe youngest then devised a scheme to make her own getaway. She gained more time by feigning sickness and telling him it was no use coming back until twelve midnight, because she will not have his dinner ready before then.  Then she stuffed straw into her clothes, and propped up the figure by the hearth, making the dummy look like it was holding a stirring-stick (tvare, pictured right) in its hand. She then ran back home to her mother, and had a sharpshooter to stay with them.  The troll came back to his home demanded his supper; when the straw-woman did not answer, he struck and realized what had happened; then he saw the bodies of her sisters were missing as well.  Raging, he came after them, but the sharp shooter scared him off.  He went back, but just as he was to go below ground, the sun rose, and he shattered into bits.\n\n\n"

He played cards with a stranger and lost all his money; then the stranger offered to give it back on another game, but if the prince lost, he would have stay at the inn for three years and then be his servant for three years. The prince agreed and lost.\nAfter three years at the inn, he went to the kingdom where the stranger, a king, lived. He met a woman with a child crying from hunger and gave the child his last bread and water. The mother told him to go to a garden, where there would be a tank. Three doves would bath there. He should grab the last one's robe of feathers and refuse to give it back until the dove gave him three things. He did as she said, and the dove gave him a ring, a collar, and one of her feathers, which could summon her. She told him that the king was her father, and hated his father, which was why he had made the prince lose.\nWhen he arrived, the king gave him wheat, millet, and barley; he was to sow them, so that the king could have bread the next day. The prince summoned the dove, who sent him to bed. In the morning, he had the loaves of bread.  Then the king ordered him to find the ring his oldest daughter had lost in the sea.

    "plot": "After the king of Denmark dies, the queen is so inconsolable that her only child, the prince, suggests that they should go to a place on the other side of a forest. They become lost in the woods, but come upon two houses, the first containing a mail shirt and a sword, with a note that said they would keep a man safe from all danger, which the prince, unbeknownst to his mother, takes. The second house contains food and a bed (granting them both food and a place to sleep), but unfortunately it is a robber's den, and the next morning, when the prince is off hunting for the path, the queen is surprised by the robber chief, who tells her that if she wants to live, she must make him king in her husband's place and must kill her son. When the queen protests that she cannot do this, the robber chief tells her to pretend to be ill and send her son after some apples in a forest a mile away, knowing that the forest \"was full of wild animals who would tear to pieces any traveller who entered it.\"\nWhat happens next depends on the version of the story. One version says that the prince fights the forest creatures and wins; Lang's version, however, states that the forest \"was full of lions and tigers, and bears and wolves, who came rushing towards him; but instead of springing on him and tearing him to pieces, they lay down on the ground and licked his hands.\" Once the creatures are no longer a threat, the prince finds the apple tree; when his sword brushes against it, two apples fall. After taking the apples, he starts to leave the wood, but a little black dog leads him to a tiny hole in the hill, which the sword enlarges enough for the prince to enter. A princess of Arabia is chained to an iron pillar within; twelve robbers had captured her and were fighting over who would marry her. She further says that she had been imprisoned there for twenty years. A touch of the prince's sword breaks the chain, and he leads her through the forest to a port containing a ship bound for Arabia, pledging that if he is still alive the following year, he will come to Arabia and wed her. She gives him a ring as a pledge of their promise, and sails home.\nThe robber smells the apples while the prince is still far away and, deciding that only powerful magic could have saved the prince from the animals, orders the queen to tell the prince that she had dreamed that he had been attacked by wild animals and to ask how he'd survived. The prince tells her about the magic mail shirt and magic sword, which the queen then tells the robber chief, who makes a sleeping draught for the prince and steals the sword and mail shirt, claiming they are his brother's.\nWhen he awakens, the robber gives him a choice: either die or be blinded and left in the forest. The prince, aware that his mother has betrayed him, chooses blindness. The robber and queen go back to Denmark, where they marry and the robber becomes king.\nThe prince wanders until he arrives at the port, where there is a ship bound for Arabia. The captain, pitying the blind man, offers to take him to Arabia. Once there, the prince goes to the public baths, where the ring slips from his fingers; a slave finds it and brings it to a friend of his who lives in the palace, who recognizes it as the princess's ring. The friend passes it on to his daughter, who is the princess's favorite servant. The princess, on seeing it, identifies it as the ring of her betrothed, and, despite the objections of her father, who does not feel that a blind man can rule after him, the princess and the prince are married.\nOne day, the prince overhears two ravens saying that the dew that falls in a certain part of the garden on Midsummer's Eve restores sight to those with bad eyes, or even no eyes at all. The prince tries it, and finds, to his delight and that of the princess, that he can see once more.\nAs the princess falls asleep due to the heat, the prince sees, about her neck, a small shining lamp on a chain. The prince unfastens the chain to examine the lamp, but drops the lamp pendant, which is instantly snatched up by a hawk. The prince chases the hawk for so long that he ends up in the same woods as before.  When the princess wakes, she follows him and is captured by the same robbers.\nThe prince finds twelve youths seeking service.  He joins them, and they all go to work for a troll, who tells them they have to care for his house for a year and then answer three questions.  Those who succeed will receive a sack of gold; those who fail will be turned into beasts.\nAfter a year, the prince heard the troll talking with another troll, saying he would ask how long they had been there (the twelve young men having been so busy partying that the troll was certain they did not know a year had passed), what shone on the roof (the lamp that the troll had stolen from the princess as she slept), and where their food came from (the king's table). When the troll asked these questions, the others did not know, but the prince answered all the questions correctly, so they all received their gold and left. On the way, they met an old beggar who asked for a piece of money for a poor man; the prince gave him his whole sackful. It was the troll in disguise, and he gave the prince the lamp he had stolen, telling him that the princess was in the same cave where the prince had found her.\nThe prince disguises himself as a peddler and then orders a great many pots and pans from a goldsmith, using them to distract his mother with them while he searches for and then reclaims the sword and mail shirt. When the robber chief returns, the prince strips him of his fine clothes and sends him into the forest, \"where the wild beasts tore him to pieces,\" and sent his mother back to her own country. He rescues his wife and they reign, for a long, long time, over both her country and his.\n\n\n"

A \"tapping at [his] chamber door\" reveals nothing, but excites his soul to \"burning\". The tapping is repeated, slightly louder, and he realizes it is coming from his window. When he goes to investigate, a raven flutters into his chamber. Paying no attention to the man, the raven perches on a bust of Pallas above the door.\nAmused by the raven's comically serious disposition, the man asks that the bird tell him its name. The raven's only answer is \"Nevermore\". The narrator is surprised that the raven can talk, though at this point it has said nothing further. The narrator remarks to himself that his \"friend\" the raven will soon fly out of his life, just as \"other friends have flown before\" along with his previous hopes. As if answering, the raven responds again with \"Nevermore\". The narrator reasons that the bird learned the word \"Nevermore\" from some \"unhappy master\" and that it is the only word it knows.Even so, the narrator pulls his chair directly in front of the raven, determined to learn more about it. He thinks for a moment in silence, and his mind wanders back to his lost Lenore. He thinks the air grows denser and feels the presence of angels, and wonders if God is sending him a sign that he is to forget Lenore.  The bird again replies in the negative, suggesting that he can never be free of his memories.  The narrator becomes angry, calling the raven a \"thing of evil\" and a \"prophet\". Finally, he asks the raven whether he will be reunited with Lenore in Heaven. When the raven responds with its typical \"Nevermore\", he is enraged, and, calling it a liar, commands the bird to return to the \"Plutonian shore\"\u2014but it does not move. Presumably at the time of the poem's recitation by the narrator, the raven \"still is sitting\" on the bust of Pallas. The narrator's final admission is that his soul is trapped beneath the raven's shadow and shall be lifted \"Nevermore\".\n\n\n"

    "plot": "A mermaid offered a fisherman much fish in return for his son.  He said he had none.  In Campbells' version, she offered him grains:  three for his wife, three for a mare, three for a dog, three to plant in the yard; then there would be three sons, three foals, three puppies, and three trees, and she should have one son when he was three.  In Jacobs's version, she merely said he would have a son, and when the boy was twenty, she would take him.\nIn Campbell's version, the mermaid let him put her off until the boy was twenty.\nIn both, the father grew troubled.  The son (or oldest son) wormed the problem out of him, and told him to get him a good sword.  He set out on horseback, with a dog, and came to where a dog, a falcon, and an otter quarreled over a sheep carcass.  He split it up for them if they came with him and aided him.\nHe took service with a king, as a cowherd, and his pay was according to the milk.  Nearby, the grass was poor, and so were the milk and his wages, but he found a green valley.  When he pastured the cows there, a giant challenged him for grazing in his valley.  He killed the giant.  Taking none of its treasure, he took back the cows, which gave good milk.  The next day, he took the cows further and had to fight another giant, with help from the dog.  The third day after that, he took them still further and met a hag who tried to trick him, but he killed her with the help of the dog.\nWhen he went back, everyone was lamenting.  A monster with three heads lived in the loch, and got someone every year; this year the lot had fallen to the king's daughter.  The general said he would rescue her, and the king had promised to marry him to the daughter if he did.  The son went to see.  When the monster appeared, the general ran off.  The princess saw a doughty man on a black horse, with a black dog, appear.  He fought the creature and had off one head, drawing a withy through it.  He gave it the princess, who gave him a ring.  He went back to his cows, and the general threatened to kill her if she did not say that he did it.  The next day, the king's daughter had to go back, because there were two heads left.  The son came again and slept, telling her to rouse him when the creature came; she did, putting an earring of hers on his ear as he said, and they fought, and he cut off the second head.  The same thing happened the third time, and the creature died.\nThe king sent for the priest to marry his daughter to the general.  The king's daughter said that first he must take the heads from the withy.  He could not.  Finally, the cowherd did.  The king's daughter said the actual killer had her ring and two earrings, and he produced them.  The king, displeased, ordered him better dressed; the king's daughter said he had good clothing, and he dressed in golden clothing from the giant's castle to marry her.\nOne day they walked by the loch, and the sea-maiden took the prince.  The princess was advised by an old smith to wear her jewelry and offered it to the sea-maiden for the prince, in Campbell's variant, which she agreed to, or by a soothsayer to play music and not stop until the sea-maiden gave her a sight of the prince, which let the prince call on the falcon and escape.\nBut the princess was captured.\nThe same person who advised the prince told him that on an island, there was a white deer.  If it were caught, a hoodie crow would jump from it; if it were captured, a trout would spring from it, but there would be an egg in the trout's mouth, and if it were broken, the sea-maiden would die.\nThe sea-maiden sank any boat that came to the island, but his horse and dog jumped to it.  The dog chased the deer.  The prince called on the dog from the sheep carcass, and with its aid, caught it.   The hoodie sprang out, and with the falcon from the carcass, he caught it.  The trout sprang out, and with the aid of the otter from the carcass, he caught it.  The sea-maiden told him she would do what he asked if he would spare her.  He demanded his wife.

His father asked what had made him ill, in hopes that it would reveal his cure, and the son revealed the curse and asked permission to search the world for her.  His father granted it.\nThe prince set out with an old steward, and after three old men gave them directions and warnings, he finally found the mountain where the princess sat behind seven veils and never spoke.  The mountain was surrounded by human bones and mourners, who warned the prince that he needed the leave of the sultan to be escorted into the princess's presence, and the bones could tell him the effect of his decision.  The prince could not think of a way to make her talk, so he put off speaking to the sultan until he had one.\nWhile there, the prince bought a nightingale, and found it could talk. It asked him why he was so sad, and when he told the bird his story, she told him to go, and when the princess would not speak, he must tell her he would instead converse with the candlestick, where the nightingale would be hidden.  The prince obeyed.  The princess would not speak to him, so he spoke to the candlestick, and the nightingale said it had been years since anyone had spoken to her, so she would tell him a story.\nShe described how a king set three wooers to learn something in six months, and the cleverest would win the princess.  One learned how to travel a year's journey in an hour; another to see things at a distance; the third to cure any illness.  They met again, and the second saw the princess was dying, the first brought the third to her, and the third one cured her.  Then the prince and the nightingale argued whether the second or the third had done the better, until the princess burst out that it would have been useless without the first, who should have her.\nA slave ran to tell the sultan, but the princess persuaded him, by signs, to make the prince make her speak three times.  She destroyed the candlestick.\nThe next night, the nightingale hid on a pillar, and the prince talked to it.  The nightingale told of a woman who had scorned wooers for many years, until she found a white hair and decided to pick one.  She set them to tasks.  She told the first wooer that her father had died, and proved to be a wizard because his grave was empty; the man's task was to lay in the grave three hours, so the woman would be free of him.  He lay down there at once.  She told a second wooer that a wizard had taken the place of her father's body in the grave; if he stood over the wizard with a stone and smashed his head if he moved, she would be free.  The man took such a stone and sat down at once.  She told a third wooer that a wizard had taken the place of her father's body in the grave, but if he brought him before her, she would be free.  He immediately brought the body before her.  Then the nightingale argued whether the second or third wooer had done the best, until the princess said it was the first.  That day, she destroyed the pillar.\nThe third night, the nightingale hid in the curtains by the door, and told the prince of a carpenter, a tailor, and a student who lived in the same house.  The carpenter made a statue of a woman; the tailor dressed it; the student prayed to heaven that she might become a living woman.  The nightingale and prince quarreled over whether the carpenter or the tailor had the best right to marry her, until the princess said that the student's prayer meant he should win her.\nAt that, her veils fell, and she agreed to marry the prince.

He came to three cottages, in each of which a fairy lived with her son. They urged him not to pursue Zoulvisia. He gave them a mirror, a pair of scissors, and a razor, telling them that if blood appeared on them, they should come to his aid.\nUpon finding Zoulvisia's palace, he found an old man trapped in a pit outside the palace walls, who told him that Zoulvisia kept him prisoner there. He told how Zoulvisia could look over all her lands at sunrise, but if he hid in a certain cave, protecting it with a stick, he would survive and could come out on her third cry, having broken her power. He did that, and Zoulvisia admitted he had defeated her. She became his wife, freed the old man, and gave him her magical fiery horse.\nOne day, he hunted, having received a case of pearls with one of Zoulvisia's hair, and a stag led him far, and he lost the case in a river without realizing it. It was swept downstream, and a watercarrier found it and brought it to the wicked king of that land. Struck by its wealth and the beauty of the golden hair within the case, the wicked king demanded the chamberlain discover its secrets or the chamberlain would lose his head. In a fright, the chamberlain sought any who could explain the case and an old woman told the chamberlain that it belonged to a beautiful woman named Zoulvisia. The chamberlain told her that if she brought him Zoulvisia, he would give her more gold.\nAn old witch set off and arrived, on a raft, just as the king prepared to return to his wife from a day of hunting. He offered to help the witch, but his horse would not let him take her up, for it sensed her wickedness; she guessed why and said she feared falling off, so she would walk. When they arrived at the palace, the witch ingratiated herself with Zoulvisia's servants until the young queen trusted her. The witch persuaded Zoulvisia that her husband must be keeping a secret from her, the secret of his strength, and that he did not love her unless he would share it. Zoulvisia believed, and plead with her husband to know his secret, so that she would be sure that he loved her. He confessed the secret of his strength, a sabre that never left his side. To prove that her husband did indeed love her, Zoulvisia ran at once and confessed the secret to the witch, exactly as the witch had planned. The witch stole the sabre, struck the king down with poisonous snakes, and kidnapped Zoulvisia to sell the beautiful young queen to the wicked king.\nThe fairies' sons saw that something had happened to the young king. They went to his castle and could not find the sabre. They caught fish to eat, and a great fish thrashed in the water because it had eaten the sabre. They brought it to the king, who recovered. He set out on Zoulvisia's fiery horse. He found the place where the wicked king was going to marry Zoulvisia, though Zoulvisia greatly resisted him and wished to escape to her beloved husband. The young king had an old beggar woman bring his ring to Zoulvisia. She told the beggar woman to tell the wicked king that Zoulvisia had come to her senses and would marry him, and to tell the man who gave the ring to await her in a garden in three days.\nThe wicked king loosened the guard on her, and she went to the gardens on the day of her supposed wedding, unattended by the wicked king's guards. There, with a flash of fire and crack of thunder, the young king rode down on his fiery horse and rescued Zoulvisia, returning them both to her palace by the river to live happily ever after.\n\n\n"

One day, he saw a swan driving away one of its thirteen cygnets, and a seer explained that any man or beast with thirteen young should drive one away, to fall under Heaven's will.  The king could not bear to choose one of his sons.  The seer said he should shut the door on the last son to return that night.  This was the oldest, Se\u00e1n Ruadh.  He asked his father for an outfit for the road, and the king gave him it and a black horse that could run faster than the wind.\nOne day, he put on some poor clothing and was hired by a king to herd his cows.  The king also told him that an urfeist, a sea serpent, demanded a king's daughter every seven years, and this year the lot had fallen on his own daughter.  Many king's sons said they would save her, but her father did not believe them.  The sea serpent would appear one day, he did not know when.\nThree giants lived near the king's lands.  Se\u00e1n Ruadh pastured the cows on their lands, and fought with them, one per day.  They promised their swords of light and horses if he would spare them, but he killed them, and their housekeepers, glad to be freed, showed him all their treasures.  Each day the cows gave more milk than they ever had before.\nOn the fourth day, he dressed in the black clothing of the first giant, took its black horse, and went down the shore.  The princess awaited the sea serpent there.  Se\u00e1n Ruadh asked her to take his head in her lap until it arrived; then she should wake him.  She took it, took three hairs from his head, and woke him when the sea serpent arrived.  They fought.  Se\u00e1n Ruadh cut off its head, but it instantly grew back.  The sea serpent left, but said it would return.\nThe next day, he wore the blue clothing of the second giant and rode its brown horse, but when he laid down as before, the princess compared his hair to the three hairs and noted he was the same knight as the first one.  He cut the sea serpent in half, but the halves joined again, and it threatened that no one would save her the third day.\nThe third day, he wore the many-colored clothing of the third giant, with its blue glass boots, and rode its red horse.  When he was dressed the housekeeper told him that no one could fight the sea serpent that day; the only way to defeat him was to throw the brown apple she gave him down its open mouth.  He took it.  Again, the princess knew him by the hairs.  He threw the brown apple, and the sea serpent melted away into jelly.  The princess grabbed his boots and one came off.  He had to leave it with her.\nMany men claimed to be the hero, but a seer said they must all try on the boot.  Finally, every man had tried it except the cowherd.  They sent twenty men for him, but he overpowered them; when they sent another twenty, he overpowered them as well; finally, the seer told the king to go himself, and when the king asked and told him not to mind his work, Se\u00e1n Ruadh came.  The boot fitted on of its own.  The princess jumped to his arms.  He was told that the men swarming about had claimed to have saved her, and he cut off all their heads.  Then he married the princess at a great wedding feast and took her with him to the giants' lands.\n\n\n"

He agrees, but her stepdaughter hears and runs to the sheep, lamenting.  Her mother tells her not to eat anything made from her body but bury the bones.  She does so, and a birch tree grows on the grave.\nThe king gives a festival, inviting everyone, and the witch sends off the husband with her younger daughter, throws a potful of barleycorns in the hearth, and tells the older stepdaughter that if she does not pick barley corns from ashes, it will be worse for her.  The birch tells her to strike the hearth with one of her branches, which sorts them, and then magically bathes and dresses her. Then it told her to go to the fields and whistle, for a horse, partly gold, partly silver, and the third partly something more precious will appear to take her to the castle. The girl then goes into the festival.\nThe king's son falls in love with her, and has her sit beside him, but the witch's daughter gnaws bones under the table, and the king's son, thinking she is a dog, gives her such a kick to keep her away that her arm is broken.  He has the door latch smeared with tar, and when the stepdaughter leaves, her copper ring is caught in it.  When the witch returns home, she tells the stepdaughter that the king's son has fallen in love with her daughter and carries her about, only he had dropped her and broken her arm.\nThe king holds another festival.  The witch tries to keep her stepdaughter busy by throwing hemp-seed on the hearth, but the stepdaughter, with the birch's aid, goes to the festival as before. This time, the king's son breaks the witch's daughter's leg, and has the doorpost smeared with tar, so that her silver circlet is caught.\nThe king holds a third festival.  The witch tries to keep her stepdaughter busy by throwing milk on the hearth, but the stepdaughter, with the birch's aid, goes to the festival as before. This time, the king's son kicks out the witch's daughter's eye, and has the threshold smeared with tar, so that one of her golden slippers is caught.\nThe king's son then sets out to discover who the maiden was, with the circlet, ring, and the slipper. When he is about to try them on the stepdaughter, the witch intervenes and gets them on her daughter. He takes both the daughter and the stepdaughter, and when they came to a river, the stepdaughter whispers to the prince not to rob her of her silver and gold. He throws the witch's daughter over the river to serve as a bridge and he and the stepdaughter cross, and takes her for his bride. Then they visit the magical birch tree and get treasures and gifts. The tree vanishes soon after. While stretching as a bridge in her grief, the younger sister wishes that a hollow golden stalk grow out of her navel so that her mother would recognize her. Immediately a hollow golden stalk grows out of her on the bridge.\nIn time, the older stepsister delivers a son. The witch, hearing of this, and believing she is her daughter, goes to the castle, and on her way, seeing the golden stalk, is about to cut it. Her daughter cries out not to cut her navel, and that she is the bridge. The witch hurries to the castle and turns the older stepdaughter into a reindeer while the witch's daughter replaces her.\nThe king is told by an old widow that his wife is in the forest in the shape of a reindeer, and his present wife is the witch's daughter. When he asks how he can get her back, the widow tells him to let her take the child into the forest. When she goes for it, the witch objects, but the king's son insists on her taking it. In the forest, the widow sings to the reindeer, which then comes and suckles her child, and tells the woman to bring it again next day.\nNext day, the witch again objects, but the widow takes it to the reindeer as before. The child becomes extremely beautiful, and its father asks the widow if it is possible for his wife to regain her human shape. The widow does not know, but tells him to go to the forest, and when the reindeer throws off its skin he is to burn it while she is searching his wife's head.\nAll this is done, and she resumes her human shape; but not liking to be seen naked, she turns into a spinning wheel, a washing-vat, and a spindle, all of which her husband destroys till she becomes human again. On their return to the castle, he orders a huge fire to be made under the bath with tar, and its approach to be covered with brown and blue cloth. Then he invites the witch's daughter to take a bath. She and her mother, in stepping over the cloth, fall a depth of three fathoms into the fire and tar to their death; the witch puts a curse on all mankind.In the ending to Andrew Lang's version of this fairy tale, after the older stepdaughter is turned back into a human, after being asked that she won't be eaten up, the witch and her daughter both run away, and if they have not stopped still, at a great age.

When he would not be put off from his prize, they gave him the maid, and she turned into a beautiful woman.  He married her.  He went to play again, and his wife warned him that it was her father, and he should take only the dun shaggy filly that has the stick saddle on her.  He won, and got the filly.\nHe went to play a third time, and this time he lost.

She told him to listen to his horse.\nThe horse bore him to the castle of the king of the oak windows and sent him into the king's chambers while the king ate, warning him to take it softly.  He made a soft sound, and the horse told him they must flee.  They were chased by a swarm of brown horses, which they could outrun, and then by a swarm of black horses, one white-faced and with a rider.  The King's horse told him that horse was its brother and the first best horse, and faster; he must cut off the head of the rider, the king.  He did, and his horse had him ride the black horse home.

He went to feed the horses, and they would not let him come near.  He said if he had his soul in his body, they would have killed him.  She asked where it was; he told her in the Bonnach stone, near the edge.  When he left the next day, she pushed it so it was steady on the ledge, and told him she was afraid it would be hurt.  He said his soul was in the threshold.  She cleaned it, because his soul was in it, and he told her that a stone was under the threshold, and a sheep under it.  The sheep held a duck, the duck held an egg, and the egg held his soul.\nThe king and queen moved the threshold and the stone.  The sheep escaped, and the king called on the dog to catch it; the duck escaped, and the king called on the falcon to catch it; the egg rolled into the river, and the king called on the otter to retrieve it.

    "name": "Udea and her Seven Brothers",
    "plot": "\nA man and wife had seven sons.  One day, the sons set out hunting and told their aunt that if their mother had a daughter, to wave a white handkerchief, and they would return at once; but if a son, a sickle, and they would keep on.  It was a daughter, but the aunt wished to be rid of the boys, so she waved a sickle.  The daughter, Udea, grew up not knowing about her brothers.  One day, an older child taunted her for driving her brothers away, who were forever roaming the world; she questioned her mother and set out to find them.  Her mother gave her a camel, some food, a cowrie shell about the camel's neck as a charm, an African, Barka, and his wife to take care of her.  On the second day, Barka told Udea to get off the camel so that his wife could ride in her place.  The mother was close by and told Barka to leave Udea alone. On the third day, Barka again told Udea to let his wife ride the camel in her place, but the mother was now too far away to hear and command Barka.  Udea called out for her mother to no avail and Barka threw the girl to the ground.  The wife climbed onto the camel and Udea walked on the ground, her bare feet cut up because of the stones on her path.\nOne day, they passed a caravan, where they were told of the castle where the brothers lived.  Barka let Udea ride the camel to the castle, but smeared her with pitch, so that her brothers would not recognize her. However, they accepted her without question.  Her tears of joy left white marks on her face.  One alarmed brother took a cloth and rubbed the mark until the pitch was gone.  The brother asked her who had painted her skin black, to which she would not answer, in fear of Barka's anger.  She finally relented, describing the treatment she received during her travels.  The seven brothers were outraged and beheaded both Barka and his wife.\nThe brothers went hunting for seven days, instructing Udea to lock herself in the castle with only the cat who grew up in the house.  She would follow the cat's advice in all matters and eat nothing that the cat did not eat.  They returned, and found her well.  The brothers then told her of the castle elves and pigeons, who could be called to fetch the brothers in case Udea was in any danger.  The pigeons had seven days' worth of food and water left by the brothers during each hunting trip; Udea asked why they did not have her feed the pigeons daily, because the food they had laid out was old after seven days.  They agreed and told her any kindness towards the pigeons would be considered a kindness towards themselves.\nOn the brothers' third hunting trip, Udea was cleaning the castle and, forgetting her instructions for a moment, found a bean and ate it.  The cat demanded half.  Udea said she could not, because she had already eaten it, and offered one hundred other beans.  The cat only wanted the bean that Udea had eaten.  To punish the girl, the cat put out the fire in the kitchen.  With no way of cooking, Udea climbed up the castle, saw a fire in the distance and left to find its source.  She asked for a lump of burning coal from the elderly man tending the fire, but he was in fact a \"man-eater\" (cannibal) and demanded a strip of blood from her ear to her thumb in return.  She bled all the way home, and did not notice the raven that had followed her back until she came upon the castle door.  Startled, she cursed the raven, hoping to startle it as well.  It asked why she would wish harm to one that had done her a favor.  It flew off, along with the dirt it had used to cover her trail of blood.  The man-eater followed this path to the castle and broke six doors in six nights, intending to attack and eat Udea.  On the last day, with only one door in place, she sent a letter to her brothers with the help of the castle pigeons.  The brothers immediately came home and trapped the man-eater in a burning pit.\nAs the man-eater burned, only one of his fingernails was left behind.  It was blown towards and stabbed Udea under her own fingernail.  She collapsed, lifeless.  Her brothers put her on a bier and the bier on a camel, and set it off to their mother.  They ordered the camel to avoid capture and stop only when someone said, \"string.\"  During the journey, three men chased after the camel, but only when one said that his sandal string was broken did it stop.  The man took Udea's hand and attempted to pull off her ring.  This motion freed the man-eater's fingernail from her hand, and she woke up full of life.  The camel returned her to her joyful brothers, and all the siblings set out to see their parents once again.\nOn the fourth day of their reunion, the eldest brother told their parents of their aunt's treachery and the adventures they had encountered.\n\n\n"

She also believes that Bostick's birding obsession is what destroyed his two previous marriages. He is so competitive that the others use his name as a kind of expletive: \"Bostick!\"\nBrad is a skilled birder who can identify nearly any species solely by sound. He hates his job maintaining the operational software of a nuclear power plant in Lansdowne, Pennsylvania. Living with his parents after a failed marriage, an aborted career at Dell, and dropping out of grad school, he hopes that doing a Big Year will give him a sense of purpose and possibly even make his father proud of him.Stu is the founder and CEO of an enormous Manhattan-based chemical conglomerate which he built from the ground up, starting in his garage. After decades of corporate success, he is ready to retire to Colorado with his architect wife. Fear of an empty schedule led him to come back from a previous retirement, but now he wants to leave his company in the hands of his two lieutenants (Kevin Pollak and Joel McHale). The company is in the middle of complicated negotiations to merge with a competitor, so his two anointed successors keep calling him back to New York for important meetings; to some extent he is a prisoner of his own success. A Big Year has been his lifelong dream and he's pursuing it with the full support of his wife.\nThe movie portrays various incidents that take place during the Big Year event, while the trio compete with each other and many other birders to achieve the world record of sighting the highest number of birds. Brad and Stu become friends and help each other in the competition, and Brad is attracted to a fellow birder, Ellie (Rashida Jones). Meanwhile, the highly competitive Bostick resorts to dirty tricks to boost his own count while undermining the others.\nAs the year draws to a close, Stu is happily retired and enjoying his newborn grandson; Brad develops a relationship with Ellie; and Bostick is alone, as his wife has left him. Stu and Brad, now close friends, congratulate each other on \"a very big year\", after each sighting 700+ bird species that year. When the Big Year results are published, Bostick won the competition with 755, a new record; Brad came in second; Stu was fourth.

First he says that the one who can obtain the smallest and most beautiful dog will be the next king, and gives them a year to obtain it.\nThe three princes set off separately. The youngest son travels for some time, seeking smaller dogs, until he discovers a fantastically decorated castle hidden in the woods. He soon discovers that it is inhabited entirely by intelligent, talking cats. Their queen is a beautiful little white cat, who invites the prince to dinner and entertains him. He is surprised to see that the cat wears a locket containing a portrait that looks just like him. The prince remains in the white cat's castle happily for nearly a year, enjoying many entertainments, until the white cat reminds him of his mission and bestows him with an acorn, telling him that the dog is inside. When he returns home and breaks open the acorn, inside is an impossibly tiny dog which dances before the king.\nAlthough the youngest prince is clearly the winner of the contest, the king sends the princes out once more, this time in search of muslin fine enough to be drawn through the eye of a needle. While his brothers begin to search once more, the youngest prince returns immediately to the white cat's castle and spends another year there. At the end of the year, she sends him home with a fine escort and golden chariot, as well as a walnut. The older two princes bring muslin which can fit through the eye of a large needle.

Inside the smallest seed is a massive amount of muslin, magnificently embroidered, which fits through the eye of any needle.\nThe king sets a third task, telling them that whoever can win the most beautiful princess for a bride would be king. The youngest prince returns once more to the white cat's castle, and she promises to help him win this contest as well.

The prince at first refuses to cut off his beloved cat's head, but is eventually forced to comply. Then, from the cat's body appears a beautiful woman, while the cat courtiers are transformed into humans.\nThe princess finally explains her past. Her mother was a queen who promised her, before she was born, in return for fairy fruit. The fairies then raised her in a tower that was impossible to enter except through a high window. While the fairies arranged a marriage for her to an ugly fairy king, she fell in love with a human king who passed by her tower, and planned to escape with him. However, the fairies caught him in her tower room. They killed him and transformed her and the people of her kingdom into cats. She would only be free when she found a man identical to her dead lover.\nThe prince and the former white cat set out for the prince's kingdom, where she is found to be far more beautiful than his older brothers' brides. However, the former white cat rules over six kingdoms, and bestows a kingdom each on his father and older brothers, leaving her and the youngest son still with three kingdoms over which to reign.

When he found it was King Fortunatus's golden wig, he took it for Mardi Gras, though the horse warned him against it.  It took him to the king and stayed in the forest, in a hut of branches, while Jean went to work for the king as a stable boy.  The horses he cared for did so much better than the others' horses that he roused their envy.  He found that the wig glowed and so used it instead of candles.\nWhen Mardi Gras came, he wore the wig.  The king took him for a king's son, but Jean admitted to being his stable boy, and the king took the wig.  The other stable boys told the king that Jean said he could marry King Fortunatus's daughter, and the king demanded that Jean bring her.

A sexton told the father that he could teach the boy.  After teaching him to ring the church bell, he sent him one midnight to ring it and came after him, dressed as a ghost.  The boy demanded an explanation.  When the sexton did not answer, the boy, unafraid, pushed him down the stairs, breaking his leg.\nHis horrified father turned him out of house, so the boy set out to learn how to shudder. He complained whenever he could, \"If only I could shudder!\"  One man advised him to stay the night beneath the gallows, where seven hanged men were still hanging.  He did so, and set a fire for the night.  When the hanged bodies shook in the wind, he thought they must be cold. He cut them down and sat them close to his fire, but they did not stir even when their clothing caught on fire. The boy, annoyed at their carelessness, hung them back up in the gallows.\nAfter the incident at the gallows, he began traveling with a waggoner. When one night they arrived at an inn, the inn-keeper told him that if he wanted to know how to shudder, he should visit the haunted castle nearby.  If he could manage to stay there for three nights in a row, he could learn how to shudder, as well as win the king's daughter and all of the rich treasures of the castle. Many men had tried, but none had succeeded.\nThe boy accepted the challenge and went to the king. The king agreed, and told him that he may bring with him three non-living things into the castle. The boy asked for a fire, a lathe, and a cutting board with a knife.\nThe first night, as the boy sat in his room, two voices from the corner of the room moaned into the night, complaining about the cold. The boy, unafraid, claimed that the owners of the voices were stupid not to warm themselves with the fire. Suddenly, two black cats jumped out of the corner and, seeing the calm boy, proposed a card game. The boy tricked the cats and trapped them with the cutting board and knife. Black cats and dogs emerged from every patch of darkness in the room, and the boy fought and killed each of them with his knife. Then, from the darkness, a bed appeared. He lay down on it, preparing for sleep, but it began walking all over the castle. Still unafraid, the boy urged it to go faster. The bed turned upside down on him, but the boy, unfazed, just tossed the bed aside and slept next to the fire until morning.\nAs the boy settled in for his second night in the castle, half of a man fell down the chimney. The boy, again unafraid, shouted up the chimney that the other half was needed. The other half, hearing the boy, fell from the chimney and reunited with the rest. More men followed with human skulls and dead men's legs with which to play nine-pins. The amused boy shaped the skulls into better balls with his lathe and joined the men until midnight, when they vanished into thin air.\nOn his third and final night in the castle, the boy heard a strange noise. Six men entered his room, carrying a coffin. The boy, unafraid but distraught, believed the body to be his own dead cousin. As he tried to warm the body, it came back to life, and, confusedly, threatened to strangle him. The boy, angry at his ingratitude, closed the coffin on top of the man again. An old man hearing the noise came to see the boy. He visited with him, bragging that he could knock an anvil straight to the ground. The old man brought him to the basement and, while showing the boy his trick, the boy split the anvil and trapped the old man's beard in it, and then proceeded to beat the man with an iron rod. The man, desperate for mercy, showed the boy all of the treasures in the castle.\nThe following morning, the king told the boy that he could win his lovely daughter. The boy agreed, though upset that he had still not learned how to shudder.\nAfter their wedding, the boy's continuing complaints annoyed his wife to no end. Reaching her wits' end, she sent for a bucketful of stream water, complete with gudgeons. She tossed the freezing water onto her husband while he was asleep. As he awoke, shuddering, he exclaimed that while he had finally learned to shudder, he still did not know what true fear was.\n\n\n"

When the giant squeezes water from a boulder, the tailor squeezes milk, or whey, from cheese. The giant throws a rock far into the air, and it eventually lands.

Afraid of being killed for sending him away, the king instead attempts to get rid of the tailor by sending him to defeat two giants along with a hundred horsemen, offering him half his kingdom and his daughter's hand in marriage if the tailor can kill the giants. By throwing rocks at the two giants while they sleep, the tailor provokes the pair into fighting each other until they kill each other, at which time the tailor stabs the giants in their hearts.\n\nThe king, surprised the tailor has succeeded, balks on his promise, and requires more of the tailor before he may claim his rewards.

God returned, said that if he was that merciless, Heaven would be bare because he would have thrown everything at the earth, and threw the tailor out.\n\n\n"

    "plot": "A king and queen were in love and happy, and made their entire kingdom happy.  Nearby lived a cruel king, who heard of their joy and attacked them.  The king went to fight him but was killed and defeated.  The cruel king then captured the dead king's queen.  Because she was to have a child, he threatened to kill but actually intended to marry her child, if a daughter, to his son.  He consulted a fairy, who encouraged the queen and told the cruel king that the child would be a beautiful and accomplished daughter; the king said if it were not true, he would kill both mother and child.\nA mouse came into the queen's tower cell one night and danced, amusing her.  Although she received only three peas a day, she gave one to the mouse.  She found a cooked partridge for herself on the table.  She exchanged the peas for better food this way, but feared for her child.  Finding the mouse playing with straw, she wove a basket and rope from them, to lower the child once born.  One day, she saw an old woman there.  The woman offered to help her if she would throw her the mouse, which she loved to eat; the queen refused, and the woman stalked off.  The baby was born, and the queen named her Joliette and went to lower her.  The mouse jumped in the basket, and the queen told it that if she had sacrificed it, she might have saved her baby.  The mouse turned into the fairy and offered to care for the child.  She lowered the baby, and climbed down the rope as a mouse; then, in distress, she climbed back up, because her enemy had stolen the princess.\nMeanwhile, the jailer went to the king with the news the baby had been born.  The king came.  The queen told him a fairy had taken it.  He took her to the woods to hang her, but the fairy made her invisible, and they escaped.\nFifteen years later, they heard that the prince was to marry a turkeyherd.  Going to see, they found the ugly prince arguing with the beautiful turkeyherd, while her turkeys trampled the jewels and fine garments he had given her.  The fairy talked with her, and realized she was the princess.  She dressed her in fine clothing and went to tell the queen.  The king heard that the turkeyherd was refusing his son, and sent for her.  His soldiers were astounded to find her dressed as she was, but brought her, and the king ordered her to love his son.  She refused, and they decided to shut her up in a tower.\nThe mouse crept into their bedrooms and bit them while they slept.  When they met, they were in a rage, and killed each other.  The fairy freed the princess and spoke to the people.  They agreed to take her as their queen.  The fairy brought her a handsome prince to be her king, and they married.\n\n\n"

The widow favored her younger biological daughter, allowing her to become spoiled and idle while her older stepdaughter was left to do all the work. Every day the stepdaughter would sit outside the cottage and spin beside the well.\nOne day, she pricked her finger on the point of the spindle. As she leaned over the well to wash the blood away, the spindle fell from her hand and sank out of sight. The stepdaughter feared that she would be punished for losing the spindle, and in panic she leapt into the well after it.\nThe girl found herself in a meadow, where she came upon an oven full of bread. The bread asked to be taken out before it burned. With a baker's peel, she took all the loaves out and then walked on. Then she came to an apple tree that asked that its apples be harvested. So she did so and gathered them into a pile before continuing on her way. Finally, she came to a small house of an old woman, who offered to allow the girl to stay if she would help with the housework.\nThe woman identified herself as Frau Holle, and cautioned the girl to shake the featherbed pillows and coverlet well when she made the bed, as that would make it snow in the girl's world. The girl agreed to take service with Frau Holle, and took care to always shake the featherbed until the feathers flew about like snowflakes.\nAfter a time, the girl became homesick and told Frau Holle that it was time for her to return home. Frau Holle had been impressed by the girl's kindness and hard work so much that, when she escorted the girl to the gate, a shower of gold fell upon the girl. She also gave her the spindle which had fallen into the well. With that the gate was closed, and the girl found herself back, not far from her mother's house.\nHer mother wished the same good fortune for her biological daughter. She also set her to sit by the well and spin, but the girl deliberately threw the spindle into the well before jumping in herself. She too came to the oven, but would not assist the bread; nor would she help the apple tree. When she came to Frau Holle's house, she likewise took service there, but before long fell into her lazy, careless ways. Frau Holle soon dismissed her. As the lazy girl stood at the gate, a kettle of pitch spilled over her. \"That is what you have earned,\" said Frau Holle, and closed the gate.\nOther versions describe the first girl having a piece of gold fall from her lips every time she speaks, whilst the second has a toad fall from her lips every time she speaks.\n* That is why, in Hessen whenever it snows they say that Frau Holle is making her bed.\n\n\n"

    "plot": "\nAt the beginning of the story, a queen sits sewing at an open window during a winter snowfall when she pricks her finger with her needle, causing three drops of red blood to drip onto the freshly fallen white snow on the black windowsill. Then, she says to herself, \"How I wish that I had a daughter that had skin as white as snow, lips as red as blood and hair as black as ebony.\" Some time later, the queen gives birth to a baby daughter whom she names Snow White, but the queen dies in childbirth a short while later.A year later, Snow White's father, the king, marries again. His new wife is very beautiful, but she is a vain and wicked woman who practices witchcraft. The new queen possesses a magic mirror, which she asks every morning, \"Magic mirror on the wall, who is the fairest one of all?\" The mirror always tells the queen that she is the fairest. The queen is always pleased with that, because the magic mirror never lies. But when Snow White was seven years old, her fairness has surpassed her stepmother's fairness in the process. For example, when the queen asks her mirror, it tells her that Snow White is the fairest.This gives the queen a great shock. She becomes envious, and from that moment on, her heart turns against Snow White, whom the queen grows to hate increasingly with time. Eventually, the angry queen orders a huntsman to take Snow White into the forest to be killed; as proof that Snow White is dead, the queen demands that he returns with her heart, which she will consume in order to become immortal. The huntsman takes Snow White into the forest, but after raising his dagger, he finds himself unable to kill her when Snow White almost immediately finds out about her stepmother's evil plan, tearfully begging, \"Spare me this mockery of justice! I will run away into the forest and never come home again!\"; after seeing the tears in the princess's eyes, the huntsman reluctantly agrees to spare Snow White and brings the queen the heart of a wild animal instead.After wandering through the forest for hours, Snow White discovers a tiny cottage belonging to a group of seven dwarfs. Since no one is at home, she eats some of the tiny meals, drinks some of their wine, and then tests all the beds. Finally, the last bed is comfortable enough for her and she falls asleep. When the dwarfs return home, they immediately become aware that there is a burglar in their house, because everything in their home is in disorder. Prowling about frantically, they head upstairs and discover the sleeping Snow White. She wakes up and explains to them about her stepmother's assassination attempt, and the dwarfs take pity on her and let her stay with them in exchange for a job as a housemaid. They warn her to be careful when alone at home and to let no one in while they are working in the mountains.10 years later, Snow White grows into a beautiful young maiden. Meanwhile, the queen, who already had gotten rid of Snow White after a decade, asks her mirror once again: \"Magic mirror on the wall, who now is the fairest one of all?\" The mirror tells her that not only is Snow White still the fairest in the land, she is currently hiding with the dwarfs. The queen is furious when she learns that Snow White used her wits to fake her death by tricking the huntsman, and decides to kill the girl herself with three attempts. First, she appears at the dwarfs' cottage, disguised as an old peddler, and offers Snow White colorful, silky laced bodices as a present. The queen laces her up so tightly that Snow White collapses; the dwarfs return just in time, and Snow White revives when the dwarfs loosen the laces. Next, the queen dresses up as a comb seller and convinces Snow White to take a beautiful comb as a present; she brushes Snow White's hair with the poisoned comb. The girl gets knocked out by the poison from the comb, but she is again revived by the dwarfs when they remove the comb from her hair; finally, the queen disguises herself as a farmer's wife and offers Snow White a poisoned apple. Snow White is hesitant to accept it, so the queen cuts the apple in half, eating the white (harmless) half and giving the red poisoned half to Snow White; the girl eagerly takes a bite, and then falls into a state of suspended animation, causing the Queen to finally triumph. This time, the dwarfs are unable to revive Snow White, and assuming that the queen has finally assassinated her after a decade, they place her in a glass casket as a funeral for her.A few days later, a prince stumbles upon a dead Snow White lying in her glass coffin during a hunting trip. After hearing her story from the Seven Dwarfs, the prince is allowed to take Snow White to her proper resting place back at her father's castle. All of a sudden, while Snow White is being transported, one of the prince's servants trips and loses his balance. This dislodges the piece of the poisoned apple from Snow White's throat, magically reviving her.  The Prince soon becomes overjoyed over this miracle, and declares his love for the alive and well Snow White, who, surprised to meet him face to face, humbly accepts his marriage proposal. Soon, the prince invites everyone in the land to their wedding, excluding Snow White's stepmother.\nThe queen, finally happy to be rid of Snow White after ten years, again asks her magic mirror who is the fairest in the land. The mirror says that there was a bride of a prince, who is more fairer than her. Unaware that the bride is her stepdaughter herself, the queen decides to visit the wedding and investigate. Once she arrives, the Queen becomes frozen with rage and fear when she finds out that the prince's bride is her stepdaughter, Snow White herself. The finally fed-up Queen tries to sow chaos and assassinate her again, but the prince recognizes her as a threat to Snow White after he learns the truth from his bride; as a punishment for the attempted murder of Snow White, the prince orders for the Queen to wear a pair of red-hot iron slippers and dance in them until she drops dead. With the evil Queen finally defeated and dead, Snow White's wedding with the prince can peacefully continue.\n\nFranz J\u00fcttner's illustrations from Sneewittchen (1905)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

A neighboring king fell in love with her from her description, but much to the king's disappointment, she rejected his ambassador, saying she had no wish to be married.  A young courtier and royal favorite, called Charming, told his friends that if he had gone, she would have accepted, and the king threw him in prison.  He lamented his fate, and the king, hearing, told him what he had said was the cause of it.  Charming said that he would have drawn such a picture of the king as to make him irresistible to her, and the king decided to send him.  On the way, he helped a carp that was out of water, a raven being chased by an eagle, and an owl caught in a net; each one promised to help him.\nWhen he attempted to bring his master's suit before the princess, she told him that she had lost a ring in the river and was so vexed that she would not listen to any suit unless the ambassador brought back her ring.  His dog, Frisk, advised him to try, and the carp brought him the ring.  When he brought it to Goldilocks, she told him that a giant who was a prince had tried to marry her and was troubling her subjects.  She could not listen unless he killed the giant.  He went to fight it, and with the raven's aid in pecking the giant's eyes during the fight, he succeeded.  Goldilocks refused unless he brought her some water from the Fountain of Health and Beauty, and the owl fetched the water for him.\nThe princess agreed then and made preparations to go and marry the king, although she at times wished they could stay, and she would marry Charming.  Charming refused to be disloyal to his king.\nGoldilocks married the king but remained fond of Charming, and Charming's enemies told the king that she praised him so highly, he should be jealous.

    "plot": "A cruel king had a hideous but good-hearted son.  The king wanted to arrange an alliance by marrying his son to a princess who was as ugly as he was.  The prince, being tired enough of seeing himself, did not want to marry her.  The king imprisoned him in a tower until he consented, and sent his ambassadors anyway.  The princess did not want to consent, but her father sent her off with the ambassadors.\nMeanwhile, the prince found a room with stained glass windows, that were depicting the adventures of a man like himself, and then the central figure became a tall and handsome young man, which no longer pleased him.  He went back, and found a book, which he found depicted the same scenes, coming to life.  In one, the people told him to find them their queen.  Finally, he tried to find the key and the cabinet as depicted in the windows and book.  He succeeded and found a man's hand, which horrified him, but a voice told him he could restore it to the man and directed him to go to the gallery and search where the light was brightest.  There he found a portrait, and behind it a hidden room where a lady lay sleeping, and lamenting the fate of her beloved in her sleep.  An eagle brought him a branch of a cherry tree, he touched the lady with it, and she came to.  She implored the eagle to remain, but it left.  He asked if he could restore her beloved, and she told him he could not, but asked if he wanted something for himself.  He asked her to make him look less ridiculous.  She turned him into a tall and handsome young man and transported him from the tower.\nThe guards, trying to cover his disappearance up, told the king he was ill.  This gave him hope that the prince was weakening.  The princess arrived, and she was still unwilling.  Then the guards reported that the prince had died.  The king locked the princess up in the tower.\nShe found a room with stained glass windows, depicting herself in some windows and a slim, charming young shepherdess in others, which she thinks uses her to make the contrast.  An old woman appeared and offered her a choice between goodness and virtue; she chose goodness.  She found the same cabinet and key as the prince, and the box with the hand.  She was told to give it to an eagle as soon as she saw him.  She did so, and he became a man.  He told her how a wicked enchanter had changed him to this form because they both loved the same fairy, and she preferred him.  He offered to make her beautiful, and she accepted.  He transformed her and transported her from the tower.\nThere, she met with the transformed prince, who was now a shepherd.  They fell in love.  The princess, unable to forget that she was not really a shepherdess, could not bring herself to marry a poor shepherd.  She decided to consult an enchanter.  She found at his house, twelve cats being tormented by mice just out of reach, and the mice being tormented by a piece of bacon just out of reach.  The enchanter appeared, and she tried to flee, but spiderwebs caught her.  He asked her to marry him and told her that the cats and mice were once princes and princesses in love, but they had offended him.  She still refused him. He turned her into a grasshopper.  She fled and, once outside, lamented the pride that had made her reluctant to marry a shepherd.\nThe prince set out to find her, but was lured by a phantom into a castle where a hideous old fairy asked him to marry her.  When he refused, she set goblins on him.  He made such a good fight against them that she stopped them, showed him the phantom, and threatened to have her killed if he refused her.  He called on the fairy he had saved, and heard a voice telling him to stand firm and seek the Golden Branch.  He refused, and the fairy turned him into a cricket.\nThe cricket and grasshopper met, discovered they could both speak, and explained to each other that they had been a prince and a princess.  Two mice, both speaking, arrived at their hiding place, and one knew the way to the Golden Branch.  They went and were restored.  The fairy and her beloved arrived and arranged for them to marry at once.  The princesses who had been mice asked for help, and the fairy could not refuse anything on this happy occasion. She transformed them all back, and gave the prince and princess the castle and garden of the Golden Branch to live in.\n\n\n"

He met a little man and, when the man asked to share, he hesitated only because it was not fit.

As the two step-sisters work together to produce a new shawl, they  get into an argument over who will wear it, and end up tearing it in two through their bickering. The pair storm off, while the step-mother orders Cinderella to clear up the remnants and finish her chores, as her father returns home from business. Since her father's remarriage, Cinderella has had to sleep by the kitchen fireplace, leaving her nothing to wear but rags covered in ashes. Her father has never moved past the grief of his first wife's death, and though he is concerned for his daughter, he is just as much under the step-mother's control as Cinderella herself is. Their brief peace is interrupted, however, as the mother and sisters reenter and begin ordering them about. During supper, a beggar woman turns up, asking for shelter. The sisters and mother try to chase her off, but Cinderella offers her a place by the kitchen fire and an old pair of slippers. The beggar thanks her for her kindness and departs, leaving the preparations for the ball to resume. After choosing dresses and a quick dancing lesson, the family finally sets off for the night with the father reluctantly in tow, leaving Cinderella behind.\nAlthough lonely at first, she cheers herself up by dancing with her broom, imagining the Prince himself has asked her for a dance. She is surprised, however, when the beggar woman appears out of nowhere, wishing to return the slippers with her thanks. To Cinderella's amazement, the shoes have been transformed into dancing slippers of glass. The beggar woman throws off her disguise and reveals herself as Cinderella's fairy godmother, come to grant her wish of going to the ball. Summoning the fairies of Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter for assistance, she turns Cinderella's rags into a beautiful dress, a pumpkin and mice into a carriage and horses, and grasshoppers and dragonflies into a retinue of footmen. As she is about to leave, however, the fairy godmother warns her that the magic will only last until midnight, at which time the spell will break, and everything will revert to its original form. Only the glass slippers will remain as a gift for her kindness. She then summons twelve dwarfs, who will appear to repeat her message if she has not left by midnight. With this warning in mind, Cinderella departs for the ball.\nAct II\nThe Spring Ball is in full swing, with guests arriving from all over the kingdom and beyond to dance and pay respect to the Prince. The two step-sisters attempt to win favour with the royal court by showing off their dancing skills, but have less than successful results, much to their mother's dismay. The Prince then joins the celebrations, but finding state events such as the Spring Ball dull, and being reluctant to enter a marriage without love, he declines any offers for a dance, particularly in the case of the obnoxious step-sisters.\n\nAt this point, Cinderella arrives at the palace, transformed beyond recognition into a beautifully dressed princess. The Prince, along with everyone else, is entranced by her beauty and charm, and for the first time, he asks for a dance. As the evening passes, the two become inseparable; Cinderella quickly becomes beloved by the entire court for her graciousness and charm, while the Prince is unusually enthusiastic and cheery in her company. When refreshments are served, he gives her the honour of taking one of three oranges, a delicacy imported to the kingdom from a far-off land. Cinderella offers the other two oranges to her step-sisters, who are so flattered by the attention that they do not recognize the beautiful stranger as their sister. The Prince takes Cinderella out to the royal gardens for an evening walk, where they dance and proclaim the love blossoming between them.\nAs they return to the ballroom for the next waltz, Cinderella has completely forgotten about the time in her happiness. However, at the first stroke of midnight, the twelve dwarfs spring from the great palace clock and remind Cinderella of her godmother's warning. Terrified of being unmasked as a lowly servant in rags, she flees from the ballroom to the astonishment of the other guests. Though the Prince pursues her, she vanishes into the night moments before the spell breaks, losing one of her glass slippers in her haste and panic. The Prince is heartbroken at the thought of losing his love so soon after discovering her, but upon finding the lost slipper, he vows not to rest until he is once again reunited with her.\nAct III\nThe morning after the ball, the Prince summons every shoemaker in the kingdom, in order to find out who the slipper was made for. However, none of them claim to have crafted the shoe, or sold it to anybody recently, and he concludes that the princess must be from a foreign land. His desperate search brings him first to the Mediterranean, then to the Orient, and lands further beyond. After travelling across the world and meeting various beautiful princesses with no success, the Prince begins to search his own kingdom, trying the slipper on every maiden who attended the ball.\nBack at Cinderella's home, love has allowed the Prince to defy the laws of time and space; though she is only awakening the morning after the ball, he has already traveled the world and back again in search of his lost love. Upon waking, Cinderella initially believes that the events of the previous night were only a dream. As she relives some of the dances of the ball, she discovers the remaining glass slipper and realizes that it was all true. At breakfast, the step-sisters reminisce about the ball, and argue about who made the greater impression on the Prince at the ball. Their fighting is interrupted when the father and step-mother hurry in with the news that the Prince is on his way to their house, desperately trying a glass slipper on every girl he encounters. Upon his arrival, he tries the slipper on the two step-sisters, to no avail. The step-mother, however, demands to be given a chance and tries to force her foot into the shoe, ordering Cinderella to help her. As she bends down to assist, the remaining slipper falls from her pocket and the Prince finally recognizes Cinderella for who she is. As Cinderella successfully tries on both glass slippers, her step-family beg for her forgiveness, which she happily bestows upon them. Overjoyed to have rediscovered each other, Cinderella and the Prince are then transported away to a secret garden by the fairy godmother, where they confess their love for one another and are happily married.\n\n\n"

    "name": "The Twelve Dancing Princesses",
    "plot": "Twelve princesses, each more beautiful than the last, sleep in twelve beds in the same room. Every night, their doors are securely locked by their father. But in the morning, their dancing shoes are found to be worn through as if they had been dancing all night. The king, perplexed, asks his daughters to explain, but they refuse. The king then promises his kingdom and each daughter to any man who can discover the princesses' midnight secret within three days and three nights, but those who fail within the set time limit will be sentenced to death.\nAn old soldier returned from war comes to the king's call after several princes have failed in the attempt. Whilst traveling through a wood he comes upon an old woman, who gives him an enchanted cloak that he can use to observe the king's unaware daughters and tells him not to eat or drink anything given to him in the evening by any of the princesses and to pretend to be fast asleep until they leave.\nThe soldier is well received at the palace just as the others had been and indeed, in the evening, the princess royal (the eldest daughter) comes to his chamber and offers him a cup of wine. The soldier, remembering the old woman's advice, secretly throws it away and begins to snore loudly as if asleep.\n\nThe twelve princesses, assured that the soldier is asleep, dress themselves in fine dancing gowns and escape from their room by a trap door in the floor. The soldier, seeing this, dons his magic cloak and follows them. He steps on the gown of the youngest princess, whose cry of alarm to her sisters is rebuffed by the eldest. The passageway leads them to three groves of trees; the first having leaves of silver, the second of gold, and the third of glittering diamonds. The soldier, wishing for a token, breaks off a twig of each as evidence. They walk on until they come upon a great clear lake. Twelve boats, with twelve princes, appear where the twelve princesses are waiting. Each princess gets into one, and the soldier steps into the same boat with the twelfth and youngest princess. The youngest princess complains that the prince is not rowing fast enough, not knowing the soldier is in the boat. On the other side of the lake stands a castle, into which all the princesses go and dance the night away.\nThe twelve princesses happily dance all night until their shoes are worn through and they are obliged to leave. The strange adventure continues on the second and third nights, and everything happens just as before, except that on the third night the soldier carries away a golden cup as a token of where he has been. When it comes time for him to declare the princesses' secret, he goes before the king with the three branches and the golden cup, and tells the king about all he has seen. The princesses know that there is no use in denying the truth, and confess. The soldier chooses the first and eldest princess as his bride for he is not a very young man, and is made the King's heir. The twelve princes are put under a curse for as many nights as they danced with the princesses.\n\n\n"

By morning, the boy is thirsty, so the children go looking for a spring of clear water. However, their stepmother has already discovered their escape and has bewitched all the springs in the forest. The boy is about to drink from one, when his sister hears how its rushing sound says \"Whoever drinks from me will become a tiger\".\nDesperately, the girl begs her brother not to drink from the spring, lest he transform into a tiger and tear her to pieces. So they continue on their way, but when they come to the second spring, the girl hears it say, \"Whoever drinks from me will become a wolf\". Again, she desperately tries to prevent her brother from drinking from it. Reluctantly, he eventually agrees to her pleas but insists he drink from the next spring they encounter.

    "name": "The Master-Maid",
    "plot": "A king's youngest son set out to seek his fortune and was hired by a giant.  The first morning, the giant went out to bring his goats to pasture and ordered the son to clean out the stables and to not go into any of the rooms about the one where he slept.\n\nThe son disobeys and finds three pots bubbling with no fire, and one turns things into copper, the second into silver, and the third into gold.  Past them, he finds, in one room, the Master Maid.  She warns him that cleaning the stables as ordinary people do causes ten shovelfuls to fly back in for every one he takes out, but if he shovels with the handle, he will be able to do it.  He talks with her the day long, and they agree to marry.  In the evening, he set to his task.  He finds that she is telling the truth, and succeeds.  The giant accuses him of having spoken with the Master Maid and the prince denies it.\nThe next day, the giant orders him to bring in a horse from pasture.  The Master Maid warns him that it breathes fire, but if he uses a bit, hanging behind the door, he will succeed.  When he does, the giant accuses him of speaking with the Master Maid again, and the prince denies it.\nThe third day, the giant orders him to  go to Hell and get his fire tax.  The Master Maid tells him the directions, and that he should ask for as much as he can carry.  He retrieves it, though the man who lets him says it was well that he did not ask for a horse-load. The giant accuses him of speaking with the Master Maid again, and the prince denies it.\nThe fourth day, the giant brings him to the Master Maid and orders her to kill him and make him into a stew.  Then he lies down to sleep.  The Master Maid cuts her finger and lets three drops of blood fall onto a stool.  Then she puts all sorts of rubbish into a stew pot and sets it to stew.  Taking a chest full of golddust, a lump of salt, a flask of water, a golden apple, and two golden chickens, she sets out with the prince.  They reach the sea and start sailing over it.\nThe giant asks, three times, whether the stew is done, and the drops of blood answer him.  The third says that it is done.  The giant gets up and tries some, and realizes what the Master Maid has done.\n\nSeeing them sailing, he sets a monster to drink up the sea, but the Master Maid has the prince throw down the salt, and it transforms into a mountain, cutting off the water.  The giant sends for a monster to bore through the hill, but when he reaches the other side, the Master Maid has the prince refill the ocean by pouring the flask of water into it.  The monster drinks it up again, but before the giant can catch the couple, they reach the prince's father's lands.\nThe prince is unwilling that she should walk into his father's castle and proposes that he should fetch a coach and seven to carry her.  She says that he will forget her, and he says that he will never.  She makes him promise to go straight home and only fetch the horses, neither speaking to anyone nor eating anything.\nHe finds a wedding party for one of his brothers, and sets about getting the coach.  The wedding guests, finding he will not come in, go out with food, and when he is about to ride off, the bride's sister rolls an apple to him, and he bites it and forgets the Master Maid.\nThe Master Maid finds a dirty old hut, where an old woman lives, to stay.  She says she will clean it up and puts gold in the pot on the fires.  The gold bubbles up and gilds the cottage.  The old woman is so frightened she flees, and the Master Maid lives there.\nA constable finds her and wants her to marry him.  She sends him off for a sackful of gold, and then she says she must bank the fire.  The constable says he will do it, and once he has the poker, she says that he will hold it, and it will hold him, and he will shovel red-hot coals over himself all night.  And so he does. As soon as day broke, and he finally was able to rid himself of the poker, he set off as though the bailiff or the devil were after him.\nA clerk finds her the same manner.  When he has brought the money, she says she must shut the door.  The clerk says he will, and once he has the door latch, the Master Maid says that he will hold it, and it will hold him, and he will go back and forth all night.  And so he does.\nA sheriff finds her in the same manner.  When he has brought the money, she says she must bring in a calf.  The sheriff says he will, and once he has it by the tail, the Master Maid says that he will hold it, and it will hold him, and he will tour the world all night.  And so he does.\nThe next morning, her prince was to marry, to the bride's sister who had rolled the apple to him, but as the coach was setting out, a harness pin broke, and so did any pin they replaced it with.  The constable says that if they borrowed the poker from the Master Maid, that will hold, and they do so, and it does.\nBut the coach bottom broke, and so did any bottom they replaced it with.  The clerk says that if they borrowed the door from the Master Maid, that will hold, and they do so, and it does.\nBut then the horses would not pull, no matter how hard they were whipped.  The sheriff says that if they borrowed the calf from the Master Maid, it will pull the coach, and they do so, and it does.\nThe prince insists on inviting the Master Maid to the wedding feast.\nThe Master Maid puts the golden apple on the table and then the golden chickens, which start to fight over the apple.   The prince comments on it, and the Master Maid says that it was just as they fought to get away from the giant, and his memory is restored, so he marries the Master Maid instead of the bride's sister. The bride's sister is killed for being a witch.\n\n\n"

    "name": "Abdullah the Fisherman and Abdullah the Merman",
    "plot": "\nThe main frame story concerns Shahry\u0101r  (Persian: \u0634\u0647\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0631\u200e, from Middle Persian \u0161ahr-d\u0101r, lit. \"holder of realm\"), whom the narrator calls a \"Sasanian king\" ruling in \"India and China\". Shahry\u0101r is shocked to learn that his brother's wife is unfaithful; discovering that his own wife's infidelity has been even more flagrant, he has her killed. In his bitterness and grief, he decides that all women are the same. Shahry\u0101r begins to marry a succession of virgins only to execute each one the next morning, before she has a chance to dishonor him. Eventually the vizier, whose duty it is to provide them, cannot find any more virgins. Scheherazade (Persian: \u0634\u0647\u0652\u0631\u0632\u0627\u062f Shahraz\u0101d, from Middle Persian \u010dehr \u0634\u0647\u0631, \"lineage\" + \u0101z\u0101d \u0627\u0632\u0627\u062f, \"noble\"), the vizier's daughter, offers herself as the next bride and her father reluctantly agrees. On the night of their marriage, Scheherazade begins to tell the king a tale, but does not end it. The king, curious about how the story ends, is thus forced to postpone her execution in order to hear the conclusion. The next night, as soon as she finishes the tale, she begins another one, and the king, eager to hear the conclusion of that tale as well, postpones her execution once again. This goes on for one thousand and one nights, hence the name.\nThe tales vary widely: they include historical tales, love stories, tragedies, comedies, poems, burlesques, and various forms of erotica. Numerous stories depict jinn, ghouls, apes, sorcerers, magicians, and legendary places, which are often intermingled with real people and geography, not always rationally. Common protagonists include the historical Abbasid caliph Harun al-Rashid, his Grand Vizier, Jafar al-Barmaki, and the famous poet Abu Nuwas, despite the fact that these figures lived some 200 years after the fall of the Sassanid Empire, in which the frame tale of Scheherazade is set. Sometimes a character in Scheherazade's tale will begin telling other characters a story of his own, and that story may have another one told within it, resulting in a richly layered narrative texture.\nThe different versions have different individually detailed endings (in some Scheherazade asks for a pardon, in some the king sees their children and decides not to execute his wife, in some other things happen that make the king distracted) but they all end with the king giving his wife a pardon and sparing her life.\nThe narrator's standards for what constitutes a cliffhanger seem broader than in modern literature. While in many cases a story is cut off with the hero in danger of losing his life or another kind of deep trouble, in some parts of the full text Scheherazade stops her narration in the middle of an exposition of abstract philosophical principles or complex points of Islamic philosophy, and in one case during a detailed description of human anatomy according to Galen\u2014and in all of these cases she turns out to be justified in her belief that the king's curiosity about the sequel would buy her another day of life.\n\n\n"
